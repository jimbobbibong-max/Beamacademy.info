# Project Milestones: BEAM Academy Mobile Conversion Redesign

## v1 Mobile Conversion (Shipped: 2026-01-20)

**Delivered:** Transformed broken mobile landing page (24 clicks, 0 conversions) into conversion-optimized experience with 0.9s LCP, sticky CTAs, and 4-field form.

**Phases completed:** 1-5 (9 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Fixed mobile viewport — no zooming or horizontal scroll required (320px-428px)
- Added always-visible CTAs — hero button + sticky bar with click-to-call
- Simplified form — reduced from 10 to 4 fields with mobile keyboard optimization
- Improved content flow — clear "Years 7-12" value prop + inline testimonial
- Optimized performance — LCP 0.9s (from 3.2s), CLS 0.014, async fonts

**Stats:**

- 38 files created/modified
- 6,288 lines of HTML/CSS/JS
- 5 phases, 9 plans, ~25 tasks
- 1 day from start to ship (focused execution)

**Git range:** `4faa27e` → `77aff5b`

**What's next:** Monitor conversion rates on Google Ads traffic. Consider v2 features (A/B testing, exit intent, video testimonials) based on data.
