# Session Pause: v4 Courses Section Redesign

**Paused:** 2026-01-23
**Milestone:** v4.0 Courses Section Redesign

## Where We Stopped

**Stage:** Research phase (just starting)
**Action interrupted:** About to spawn 4 parallel researchers

## What's Done

1. ✓ v3 shipped (Phases 12-13 complete)
2. ✓ Phase 14 moved to v4 (CSS architecture issues required fresh start)
3. ✓ HTML reverted to pre-Phase 14 state (working)
4. ✓ PROJECT.md updated with v4 milestone goals
5. ✓ ROADMAP.md and STATE.md updated
6. ✓ Research directory created (.planning/research/)

## What's Next

1. Run 4 parallel researchers:
   - Stack (CSS architecture patterns)
   - Features (pricing/course UX best practices)
   - Architecture (site integration, page flow)
   - Pitfalls (common mistakes to avoid)

2. Synthesize research into SUMMARY.md

3. Define requirements from research

4. Create roadmap with phases

## Key Context

- User wants full research — "DYOR and think holistically"
- No specific vision for Courses section — let research guide it
- Previous attempt failed due to messy CSS with duplicates
- Need clean CSS architecture, mobile-first

## Resume Command

```
/gsd:resume-work
```

This will continue from the research phase.
