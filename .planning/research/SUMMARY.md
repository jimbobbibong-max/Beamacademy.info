# Research Summary: v2.0 Messaging Overhaul

**Synthesized:** 2026-01-22
**Research Files:** STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md

## The Core Insight

**The differentiator is invisible.** BEAM's data-driven personalization (track scores → identify weak spots → generate custom materials) is real and valuable, but the current site fails to communicate it. Visitors can't tell it's even a tutoring company without reading every word.

**The solution: Show, don't tell.** Portal screenshots demonstrating score tracking and custom materials will communicate the value prop faster than any headline. Visual comprehension is 60,000x faster than text.

## Stack Recommendations

| Pattern | Use For | Implementation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Show-Don't-Tell Hero** | Instant comprehension | Portal screenshot showing scores + weak topics + generated materials |
| **3-Step Process** | Simplify complex offering | "Track → Identify → Generate" with icons |
| **Before/After Comparison** | Crystallize difference | Generic tutoring vs BEAM side-by-side |
| **Social Proof Strip** | Build trust quickly | Parent testimonials with specifics ("68% → 89%") |
| **Sticky Mobile CTA** | Always-available conversion | Bottom bar after scrolling past hero |

**Typography:** 44-52px hero headline, 18px body, 48px line height for mobile scanability.

## Feature Priorities

### Must Have (Table Stakes)
- Clear value proposition headline
- Free trial offer (prominent)
- Tutor credentials with photos
- Working With Children Check badge
- Mobile-responsive design
- Contact info easily visible

### Differentiators (What BEAM Has That Others Don't)
1. **4 PDFs from ONE trial** — Diagnostic, Custom Worksheets, Personalized Paper, Solutions
2. **Student portal** — Progress tracking, topic breakdown, priority areas
3. **Specific feedback** — "78% overall, weak on trig word problems" vs "doing well"
4. **Discord support** — Help between classes

### Trust Signals
- Real tutor photos with specific credentials (not stock)
- Parent testimonials with names, suburbs, specific outcomes
- WWCC badge
- Google/Trustpilot reviews if available

## Page Structure

Recommended section order based on conversion psychology:

| Order | Section | Purpose | Content |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Hero** | Hook + Category | "Custom materials for YOUR kid" + "HSC Tutoring" + portal screenshot |
| 2 | **Proof** | Evidence | 4 documents from ONE trial visualization |
| 3 | **Comparison** | Differentiation | Generic vs BEAM side-by-side |
| 4 | **Credentials** | Trust | Tutor profiles, WWCC, testimonials |
| 5 | **CTA/Form** | Convert | Free trial form (3-4 fields max) |

**Above-fold requirements:** On mobile (600px), only headline + category label + CTA button fit. Portal screenshot should be partially visible to encourage scroll.

**Scroll depth reality:** 85% scroll past hero, 55% reach halfway, 45% reach bottom. Front-load proof and comparison before the 50% mark.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Top 5 Conversion Killers

1. **Vague value proposition** — "Personalized tutoring" means nothing. "4 diagnostic reports showing exactly where your child struggles" lands instantly.

2. **Features instead of benefits** — "Access to our portal" vs "See exactly which topics need work"

3. **Missing category clarity** — Without "HSC Tutoring" prominently visible, visitors don't know what they're looking at

4. **Jargon** — "Data-driven" sounds corporate. "We track scores" is plain English.

5. **Form friction** — 3-4 fields max. Every extra field loses 11% of conversions.

### BEAM-Specific Warnings

- "4 PDFs" needs context — show what they look like, don't just list them
- Tutor credentials need photos — text alone doesn't build trust
- Free trial needs "no catch" messaging — parents are skeptical of upsells
- Message match with Google Ads — headline should echo ad copy for 750% better CTR
