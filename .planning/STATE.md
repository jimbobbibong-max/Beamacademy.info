## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (v2)

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Custom materials" as hook | Score tracking is HOW, personalization is VALUE |
| Show don't tell | Visual comprehension 60,000x faster than text |
| 4 documents from ONE trial | Concrete proof beats abstract claims |
| Comparison table | Crystallizes difference in single scan |
| Parent-outcome headline | "Where they're struggling" speaks to parent concerns |
| Badge-style category label | Visual prominence for "HSC Tutoring" identification |
| Single CTA in hero | Remove competing buttons for clear conversion path |
| Portal mockup vs screenshot | HTML mockup loads faster, more responsive than image |
| Realistic score data | 78% overall with mix of strong/weak topics shows tracking is meaningful |
| Progress Report top-left | Most visual impact position in 2x2 grid |
| CSS mockups for documents | Preserves LCP performance (no image loads) |
| Topic gap via Focus Areas | Shows "Integration by Parts" specificity, not just overall scores |
| MCQ/Short Answer split | Shows granular tracking (85% MCQ vs 68% SA) |
| Harder math questions | Integration/differentiation questions show HSC-level rigor |
| "Teachers miss" framing | More credible than "parents miss" for gap identification |
| Pure CSS Discord mockup | Faster loads than screenshot, no privacy concerns |
| 33-min response time proof | Specific timestamps (9:14 PM, 9:47 PM) beat vague claims |
| Chris in Discord mockup | Tutor recognition continuity from Trust section |
| "Get My" for form submit | Personal pronoun creates ownership at conversion point |
| Nav CTA shortened | "Free Diagnostic" fits nav; full text on hero/sticky |

### Research Insights

- 85% scroll past hero, 55% reach halfway, 45% reach bottom
- Front-load proof and comparison before 50% mark
- Jargon ("data-driven") fails; plain English ("we track scores") lands
- Every extra form field loses 11% conversions

### Tech Debt (from v1)

- Skip button positioning (cosmetic)
- Form scroll anchor positioning (UX)
- Some aria-hidden with focusable children
- Some contrast issues
- Links without discernible names
