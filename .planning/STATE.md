| 27-01 | Update About with Real Tutor Data | COMPLETE | aea6507 |

## Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| page-structure | Single-page sections for About | Keeps trust content together, less friction |
| tutor-display | Summary cards not long bios | Research showed cards more effective |
| color-execution | Purple 30% accent, white 60%, gold 10% | Purple works best as accent not dominant |
| contact-hero | Simple centered design | Contact page is functional, not marketing-heavy |
| netlify-forms | Use Netlify for form handling | Site already on Netlify, no backend needed |
| nav-order | About, Results, Courses, Contact, CTA | Logical flow: who we are → proof → services → contact |
| cross-links | Contextual cross-links on each page | Improves internal linking and user journey |
| real-tutor-data | Use homepage tutor data | Consistency across site, real credentials |
