# Roadmap: BEAM Academy Landing Page

## Milestones

- **v1 Mobile Conversion** — Phases 1-5 (shipped 2026-01-20) | [Archive](milestones/v1-ROADMAP.md)
- **v2 Messaging Overhaul** — Phases 6-11 (active)

---

## v2: Messaging Overhaul

**Goal:** Visitors understand BEAM's differentiator (custom materials based on score tracking) within 3 seconds.

**Core insight:** The differentiator is invisible. Show, don't tell. Portal screenshots and document previews communicate value faster than any headline.

### Phase 6: Hero Overhaul

**Goal:** Visitors immediately understand what BEAM is (HSC tutoring) and why it's different (custom materials based on tracking).

**Dependencies:** None (starting point)

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Hero text content (category label, headline, subheadline, single CTA)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Hero visual (portal mockup with score tracking)

**Requirements:**
- HERO-01: Headline communicates category + differentiator
- HERO-02: Portal screenshot visible showing score tracking
- HERO-03: Category label clearly visible without scrolling
- HERO-04: Single primary CTA
- HERO-05: Subheadline explains hook in plain English

**Success Criteria:**
1. Visitor can identify "HSC tutoring" within 3 seconds without scrolling
2. Visitor sees visual proof of score tracking (portal screenshot) in hero
3. Only one primary CTA button competes for attention in hero
4. Headline communicates both WHAT (tutoring) and WHY DIFFERENT (custom materials)

---

### Phase 7: Proof Section

**Goal:** Parents see concrete evidence of what they get from ONE free trial.

**Dependencies:** Phase 6 (hero establishes context)

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Proof section with 4 document mockups, "Yours to Keep" messaging, topic gap insight

**Requirements:**
- PROOF-01: 4 documents from ONE trial visualized
- PROOF-02: "Yours to keep" messaging prominently displayed
- PROOF-03: Documents shown with visual previews
- PROOF-04: Topic gap insight shown (specific topics, not just overall score)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Parent can see all 4 document types visually (not just listed)
2. "Free even if you don't enrol" message is visible without searching
3. Topic gap insight is communicated (exposes specific weaknesses like "Calculus - Derivatives")
4. Section answers "what do I actually get?" with visuals, not text

---

### Phase 8: Comparison Section

**Goal:** Crystallize the difference between generic tutoring and BEAM.

**Dependencies:** Phase 7 (proof provides context for comparison)

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Comparison table (desktop) and cards (mobile) with 5 specific contrasts

**Requirements:**
- COMP-01: Generic vs BEAM side-by-side comparison table
- COMP-02: Specific contrasts shown

**Success Criteria:**
1. Parent can compare generic tutoring vs BEAM in single visual scan
2. Specific contrasts visible (vague feedback vs precise data, same worksheets vs custom)
3. Comparison table highlights BEAM advantages without feeling salesy

---

### Phase 9: Trust Section

**Goal:** Build credibility through tutor profiles and social proof.

**Dependencies:** Phase 8 (comparison sets up "why trust this?" question)

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Tutor profiles with trifecta badges + parent testimonial

**Requirements:**
- TRUST-01: Tutor profiles with real photos
- TRUST-02: Credibility combo per tutor (Baulko + 95+ HSC + Med)
- TRUST-03: Parent testimonials with specific outcomes
- TRUST-04: Small group size (6-8 max) prominently visible
- TRUST-05: School-specific matching mentioned

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each tutor has real photo, not stock image or avatar
2. Tutor credentials show the trifecta (selective school + high ATAR + current study)
3. At least one testimonial includes specific score improvement
4. Group size limit (6-8) is visible without searching
5. School-specific customization is mentioned (Baulko vs James Ruse formats)

---

### Phase 10: Support Section

**Goal:** Differentiate BEAM with 24/7 Discord support between classes.

**Dependencies:** Phase 9 (trust established, now show ongoing support)

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Discord mockup with 24/7 support callout and availability framing

**Requirements:**
- SUPP-01: Discord 24/7 support callout section
- SUPP-02: "Stuck at 9pm? Get help by 10am." framing
- SUPP-03: Discord screenshot showing real exchange

**Success Criteria:**
1. Discord support section exists as distinct callout
2. Framing communicates availability (not just "we have Discord")
3. Visual proof of Discord in action (screenshot of real help)

---

### Phase 11: CTA & Mobile Polish

**Goal:** Optimize final conversion path and ensure all new content works on mobile.

**Dependencies:** Phases 6-10 (all content exists to test)

**Requirements:**
- CTA-01: Outcome-focused CTA copy
- CTA-02: Form fields remain optimized (3-4 fields)
- MOB-01: All new sections render correctly on mobile
- MOB-02: Images optimized for mobile loading
- MOB-03: Sticky CTA bar still functional

**Success Criteria:**
1. CTA copy focuses on outcome ("Get Your Free Diagnostic") not action ("Submit")
2. Form has no more than 4 fields
3. All new sections (proof, comparison, trust, support) render correctly on 320px-428px
4. New images don't regress LCP (target still <2.5s)
5. Sticky CTA bar continues to function with new page structure
