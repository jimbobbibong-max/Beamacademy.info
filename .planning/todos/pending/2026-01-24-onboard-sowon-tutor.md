## Problem

Need to add Sowon to the About/Team section of the landing page. She's a new English tutor with strong credentials that should be showcased.

## Tutor Stats

- 96 in English Advanced
- Rank 3 in Baulko English Advanced
- Mentored 20+ Baulko HSC students (top student achieved 96)
- 300+ hours in English tutoring
- Coached 2x Baulko 99.95 students

## Solution

Add to About section tutor cards:
1. Use headshot from Downloads (mmexport1768474269462.jpg - verify this is correct file)
2. Create tutor card matching existing format
3. Highlight key stats: Rank 3 Baulko English, 300+ tutoring hours, mentored students to 99.95

TBD: Exact card layout and which stats to prioritize
