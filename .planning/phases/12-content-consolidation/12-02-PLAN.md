<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove redundant section HTML</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/beamacademy-site/index.html</files>
  <action>
Delete the following HTML sections entirely (including comments and section tags):

1. **Why Us Section** (lines ~6609-6652)
   - Find: `<!-- Why Us Section -->`
   - Delete through closing `</section>`
   - This is 6 feature cards that duplicate v2 messaging

2. **Portal Section** (lines ~6654-6717)
   - Find: `<!-- Student Portal Section -->`
   - Delete through closing `</section>`
   - Hero already has portal mockup

3. **Team Section** (lines ~6719-6784)
   - Find: `<!-- Team Section -->`
   - Delete through closing `</section>`
   - Now consolidated into Trust section

4. **Testimonials Section** (lines ~6786-6826)
   - Find: `<section class="testimonials"`
   - Delete through closing `</section>`
   - Now consolidated into Trust section

These sections are contiguous in the file. Delete the entire block from `<!-- Why Us Section -->` to the closing `</section>` of Testimonials.

IMPORTANT: Verify FAQ section (`<!-- FAQ Section -->`) remains intact after deletions.

  <verify>
Run: grep -n "id=\"why-us\"\|id=\"portal\"\|id=\"team\"\|class=\"testimonials\"" index.html
Expected: No matches

Run: grep -n "id=\"faq\"" index.html
Expected: Should still find FAQ section
  </verify>
  <done>Why Us, Portal, Team, and Testimonials sections removed from HTML</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove navigation links to deleted sections</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/beamacademy-site/index.html</files>
  <action>
Remove navigation links that point to deleted sections.

1. **Desktop nav** (around lines 5582-5583):
   Delete:
   ```html
   <li><a href="#why-us" class="nav-link">Why Us</a></li>
   <li><a href="#team" class="nav-link">Team</a></li>
   ```

2. **Mobile nav** (around lines 5603-5604):
   Delete:
   ```html
   <li><a href="#why-us">Why Us</a></li>
   <li><a href="#team">Team</a></li>
   ```

3. **Footer** (around line 7094):
   Delete:
   ```html
   <li><a href="#team" class="footer-link">Our Team</a></li>
   ```

Note: There is no nav link to Portal or Testimonials sections, so only Why Us, Team need removal.

Keep remaining nav links: Home, Programs/Courses, Proof, About, Contact, etc.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify remaining section order is logical</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/beamacademy-site/index.html</files>
  <action>
After deletions, verify the section order makes sense:

Expected order:
1. Hero (#home)
2. Proof (#proof) - results/stats
3. Comparison (#comparison) - vs other tutoring
4. Trust (#trust) - tutors + testimonials (now expanded)
5. Support (#support) - 24/7 help
6. About (#about)
7. Courses/Pricing (#courses)
8. FAQ (#faq)
9. Contact (#contact)
10. CTA (final call to action)

This is a verification task - no changes needed if order is correct.

If sections are out of order, reorder to match the expected flow.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: grep -n "<section" index.html | head -15
Verify sections appear in logical order: hero, proof, comparison, trust, support, about, courses, faq, contact, cta
  </verify>
  <done>Page section order is logical after removals (QUAL-02)</done>
</task>
