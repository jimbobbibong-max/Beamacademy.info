<objective>
Apply 5-question test to every section, identify and execute content cuts and consolidations.

Purpose: Remove content that doesn't move visitors closer to trial signup, reducing cognitive load and improving conversion.
Output: Streamlined beamacademy-index.html with redundant/low-value content removed.

  <name>Task 1: Apply 5-Question Test and Remove Final CTA Section</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
  Apply the 5-question test from research to evaluate the Final CTA section:

  1. Does it move visitor closer to trial signup? - The sticky bar already provides persistent CTA
  2. Does it build trust or create doubt? - Neutral, doesn't add trust
  3. Does it reduce friction or add friction? - Adds scroll length
  4. Could visitor skip and still convert? - Yes, sticky bar is always visible
  5. Is CTA opportunity clear here? - Redundant with sticky bar

  **ACTION: Remove the Final CTA section** (lines ~6938-6945 containing "Ready to Shine Brighter?")

  The sticky CTA bar already provides:
  - Phone link for immediate contact
  - "Get Your Free Diagnostic" button
  - Persistent visibility on scroll

  The final CTA section adds no unique value and extends page length unnecessarily.

  Delete the entire section:
  ```html
  <!-- CTA Section -->
      <section class="cta" aria-labelledby="cta-title">
          <div class="container">
              <h2 id="cta-title">Ready to Shine Brighter?</h2>
              <p>Join BEAM Academy today...</p>
              <a href="#contact" class="btn btn-primary">Get Your Free Diagnostic</a>
          </div>
      </section>
  ```

  Also remove any orphaned CSS for `.cta` section (check if used elsewhere first).

  <verify>
  1. Grep for "Ready to Shine Brighter" - should return no results
  2. Page loads without errors in browser
  3. Sticky CTA bar still functions correctly

  <done>Final CTA section removed, page ends with Contact form section followed by footer.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove Features Strip from Proof Section</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
  Evaluate the Features Strip (5 badges: "Personalised learning plans", "Custom worksheets", "Progress tracking", "Discord community", "Syllabus aligned"):

  5-Question Test:
  1. Does it move visitor closer to trial? - These are generic claims, not proof
  2. Does it build trust? - No, these are expectations not differentiators
  3. Does it reduce friction? - No, adds visual noise
  4. Could visitor skip and convert? - Yes, the 4 document cards ARE the proof
  5. Is CTA clear? - The section already has a CTA below it

  **Problem:** The features strip is redundant:
  - "Custom worksheets" = shown in document cards
  - "Progress tracking" = shown in Progress Report card
  - "Discord community" = shown in Support section AND Comparison table
  - "Personalised learning plans" = implied by entire diagnostic concept
  - "Syllabus aligned" = generic expectation

  **ACTION: Remove the features strip** (line ~5840 with inline styles)

  Delete:
  ```html
  <!-- Features Strip --><div class="proof-features" style="...">...</div>
  ```

  This removes visual clutter between the document cards and the section CTA, creating cleaner flow to conversion.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Grep for "proof-features" - should return no results in HTML (CSS may remain)
  2. Proof section flows directly from document cards to insight callout to CTA
  3. Visual spacing looks correct
  </verify>
  <done>Features strip removed from Proof section, reducing cognitive load and visual clutter.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Evaluate and Condense Support Section into Comparison</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
  Evaluate Support Section (Discord mockup with after-hours help):

  5-Question Test:
  1. Does it move visitor closer to trial? - Indirectly, it's a differentiator
  2. Does it build trust? - Yes, shows responsiveness
  3. Does it reduce friction? - Neutral
  4. Could visitor skip and convert? - Yes, comparison table already mentions "Discord support - stuck at 9pm, help by 10am"
  5. Is CTA clear? - Has a section CTA

  **Analysis:** The Support section IS a differentiator, BUT:
  - The Comparison table already states: "Discord support - stuck at 9pm, help by 10am"
  - This message is MORE concise and appears at a higher-value position
  - The full Discord mockup is visually impressive but may not convert better than the comparison row

  **DECISION: Keep Support section but SIMPLIFY**

  Instead of full removal, condense the Support section:
  1. Remove the 3 feature bullets below the Discord mockup ("Responses within hours", "Private server", "Same tutors") - these are already implied or stated elsewhere
  2. Keep the Discord mockup (visual proof is valuable)
  3. Keep the section CTA

  Delete the `support-features` div containing the 3 features (lines ~6169-6197):
  ```html
  <div class="support-features">
      <div class="support-feature">...</div> (Responses within hours)
      <div class="support-feature">...</div> (Private server)
      <div class="support-feature">...</div> (Same tutors)
  </div>
  ```

  This preserves the visual Discord proof while removing redundant text.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Support section still shows Discord mockup
  2. Support section still has section CTA
  3. The 3 feature bullets are removed
  4. Page loads without layout issues
  </verify>
  <done>Support section condensed by removing redundant feature bullets, keeping the core Discord mockup visual proof.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks:
1. Page loads without console errors
2. All section links in navigation still work
3. Sticky CTA bar still functions
4. Form submission still works
5. Mobile layout is not broken
6. Grep confirms removed elements are gone:
   - No "Ready to Shine Brighter"
   - No "proof-features" div
   - No "support-features" div
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Final CTA section removed (redundant with sticky bar)
- Features strip removed from Proof section (clutters, doesn't convert)
- Support section condensed (removes redundant text)
- Net reduction of 50+ lines of HTML
- Page cognitive load reduced without losing any conversion-critical elements
- All remaining sections pass the 5-question test
</success_criteria>
