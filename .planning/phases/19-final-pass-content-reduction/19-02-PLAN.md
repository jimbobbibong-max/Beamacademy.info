  <name>Task 1: Remove Dead CSS from Removed Sections</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
  After Plan 19-01 removes content, identify and remove orphaned CSS.

  **Check for dead CSS from:**

  1. **Final CTA Section** - Search for `.cta` styles that are ONLY used for the removed section:
     - `.cta` (the section class itself)
     - Look for styles like `.cta h2`, `.cta p`, `.cta .btn`
     - CAREFUL: Don't remove `.cta` if used as general CTA class elsewhere
     - Grep for `class="cta"` to verify it's only used on the removed section

  2. **Features Strip** - Check for `.proof-features` styles:
     - If Plan 01 removed the element with inline styles, no CSS cleanup needed
     - But verify no `.proof-features` class exists in CSS

  3. **Support Features** - Check for `.support-features` and `.support-feature` styles:
     - These should be safe to remove since the container is removed
     - Includes `.support-feature-icon`, `.support-feature-text`

  **Process:**
  1. Grep for each class in both CSS and HTML
  2. If class appears in CSS but NOT in HTML, it's dead - remove it
  3. Be conservative - only remove if 100% certain not used

  **Expected removals:**
  - `.support-features` and children
  - `.support-feature`, `.support-feature-icon`, `.support-feature-text`
  - `.cta` section styles (if dedicated section styles exist)

  **DO NOT remove:**
  - `.section-cta` (used in multiple sections)
  - `.btn-cta` or similar generic CTA classes
  - Any class that might apply to remaining elements
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Grep for removed CSS classes - should only appear in CSS block, not HTML
  2. Page renders correctly in browser
  3. No visual regressions on any section
  </verify>
  <done>Dead CSS removed for deleted sections (support-features, cta section if applicable).</done>

  <name>Task 2: Pre-Launch Technical Checklist</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
  Run through the pre-launch checklist from research:

  **1. Links Verification:**
  - All navigation anchor links (#home, #proof, #comparison, #trust, #support, #courses, #faq, #contact) - verify sections exist
  - External links (Instagram, Discord, Student Portal) - verify `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`
  - Phone links (`tel:`) - verify format
  - Email links (`mailto:`) - verify format

  **2. Form Check:**
  - Verify form has `action` attribute or JavaScript handler
  - Verify all form inputs have proper `name` attributes
  - Verify submit button is present and styled

  **3. Accessibility Quick Check:**
  - All images have `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative)
  - Sections have proper `aria-labelledby` pointing to valid IDs
  - Form inputs have associated labels
  - Skip link exists and is functional

  **4. Mobile Fundamentals:**
  - `meta viewport` is set correctly
  - No horizontal overflow (check CSS for `overflow-x: hidden`)
  - Touch targets are 44px minimum (already set in CSS)

  **5. SEO Basics:**
  - Unique `<title>` tag exists
  - `<meta name="description">` exists
  - Canonical URL is set
  - Schema markup is present

  **FIX any issues found.** Document in verification.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. All internal anchor links point to existing sections
  2. All external links have proper attributes
  3. Form has submission mechanism
  4. No critical accessibility issues
  5. Mobile viewport configured correctly
  6. SEO meta tags present
  </verify>
  <done>Pre-launch checklist passed, all technical issues addressed.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Final HTML Cleanup and Validation</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
  Final pass for HTML hygiene:

  **1. Remove HTML Comments That No Longer Apply:**
  - If any comments reference removed sections, remove them
  - Keep useful comments (section markers, TODOs if intentional)

  **2. Consistent Indentation:**
  - Ensure indentation is consistent (likely 4 spaces based on file)
  - Fix any obvious indentation issues from content removal

  **3. Remove Empty Lines:**
  - Multiple consecutive blank lines -> single blank line
  - Don't leave gaps where content was removed

  **4. Verify HTML Structure:**
  - All tags are properly closed
  - No orphaned `</div>` or `</section>` tags from removal
  - Proper nesting (no section inside section improperly)

  **5. Copyright Year Check:**
  - Verify footer copyright year is current (2025 or 2026)

  This is a cleanup pass, not a rewrite. Keep changes minimal and focused on hygiene.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. HTML has consistent formatting
  2. No orphaned tags or broken structure
  3. Comments are current and useful
  4. No excessive whitespace

After all tasks:
1. Open page in browser - no visual issues
2. Open DevTools Console - no errors
3. Click all navigation links - all work
4. Test form submission - functions correctly
5. Test on mobile viewport (375px) - no horizontal scroll
6. Lighthouse quick check - Performance score should remain 85+
7. File size should be smaller than before Plan 19 started
