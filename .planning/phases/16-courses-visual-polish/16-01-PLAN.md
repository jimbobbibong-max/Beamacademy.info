<objective>
Add depth shadows to pricing tiers and course cards to match Hero/About v2 quality.

Purpose: The highest-impact visual improvements - pricing tiers currently have no shadow (flat), and course cards only shadow on hover. Adding base-state shadows creates depth and visual interest.

Output: Enhanced `.pricing-tier-new` and `.course-card` CSS with shadows matching Hero card quality.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add depth shadows to pricing tiers</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Find the `.pricing-tier-new` rule (around line 1976) and update it to add:
- Base shadow: `box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);`
- Transition: `transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease;`

Then add a new hover rule for `.pricing-tier-new:hover` (after the base rule, around line 1984):
```css
.pricing-tier-new:hover {
    transform: translateY(-4px);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.3);
    border-color: var(--purple-500);
}
```

Also update the `.pricing-tier-new.featured-tier` rule to have stronger shadow:
- Change `box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);` to `box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0 0 20px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.15);`

IMPORTANT: Do NOT add hover transform to featured-tier (it already has scale transform).

  <verify>
1. Open C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html in browser
2. Scroll to "Invest in Your Future" section
3. Verify pricing tiers have visible shadow at rest (depth)
4. Hover over Junior/Senior tiers - should lift 4px and glow purple
5. Featured tier (Intermediate) should have purple glow at rest
  </verify>
  <done>
- All three pricing tiers have visible base shadow
- Non-featured tiers lift and glow on hover
- Featured tier has enhanced purple glow at rest
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add base shadow to course cards</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Find the `.course-card` rule (around line 2417) and add a base shadow:
```css
box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
```

Update the existing `.course-card:hover` rule (around line 2427) to use purple-tinted shadow:
Change `box-shadow: 0 16px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);` to:
```css
box-shadow: 0 16px 40px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.25);
```

The existing transition is already `0.3s ease` which is correct.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Open browser and scroll to "Browse Our Courses" section
2. Verify course cards have subtle shadow at rest (visible depth)
3. Hover over any course card - shadow should be larger and purple-tinted
4. Verify cards still lift (translateY) on hover as before
  </verify>
  <done>
- All course cards have visible base shadow
- Hover shadow is purple-tinted (rgba 124,58,237)
- No visual regression on card layout or interaction
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add mobile shadow reduction</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Find the existing `@media (max-width: 900px)` block that contains `.pricing-tiers-new` rules (around line 2194).

Add these rules inside that media query to reduce shadows on mobile for performance:

```css
.pricing-tier-new {
    box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.pricing-tier-new:hover {
    transform: none;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.course-card {
    box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

.course-card:hover {
    transform: none;
    box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

This reduces shadow intensity and disables translateY hovers on touch devices (hover doesn't make sense on mobile).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Open browser DevTools and toggle device mode (mobile viewport)
2. Verify pricing tiers have reduced shadows
3. Verify no hover lift effect on mobile
4. Verify course cards have reduced shadows on mobile
5. Toggle back to desktop - shadows should be full strength
  </verify>
  <done>
- Mobile shadows are lighter (performance optimization)
- No hover lift effects on mobile viewports
- Desktop shadows remain full strength
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. Desktop view: Pricing tiers and course cards have visible depth shadows
2. Desktop hover: Elements lift and glow purple on interaction
3. Mobile view: Reduced shadows, no hover transforms
4. No layout shifts or visual regressions
5. CSS validates (no syntax errors)
