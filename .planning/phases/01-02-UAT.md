## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. No Horizontal Scroll
expected: At 375px width, no horizontal scrollbar appears. All content fits within viewport.
result: pass

### 2. Form Input No Auto-Zoom
expected: Tapping the Name or Email field in the contact form does NOT cause iOS auto-zoom. Page stays at same zoom level.
result: pass

### 3. Buttons Easily Tappable
expected: All buttons (Start Free Trial, Send Message, nav links) have comfortable tap targets - no accidental mis-taps.
result: pass

### 4. Text Readable Without Zoom
expected: All text on page is readable at default zoom. No need to pinch-zoom to read anything.
result: pass

### 5. Hero CTA Above Fold
expected: "Start Free Trial" button in hero section is visible immediately on page load without any scrolling.
result: pass

### 6. Sticky Bar Appears on Scroll
expected: After scrolling past the hero section, a sticky bar slides up from the bottom with "Call" and "Book Free Trial" buttons.
result: pass

### 7. Click-to-Call Works
expected: Tapping the phone/Call button in sticky bar opens phone dialer with +61491791447.
result: pass

### 8. Book Free Trial Scrolls to Form
expected: Tapping "Book Free Trial" in sticky bar smoothly scrolls to the contact form section.
result: pass
note: User noted form scroll position could be improved - form appears slightly underneath, showing info directly under heading

### 9. Floating Button Repositions
expected: When sticky bar is visible, the floating phone button (bottom-right) moves up so it doesn't overlap the sticky bar.
result: pass

## Summary

total: 9
passed: 9
issues: 0
pending: 0
skipped: 0

## Observations (Non-Blocking)

User noted two polish items during testing (not test failures):

1. **Skip to main content button** - "halfway there" - may need styling/positioning review
2. **Form scroll anchor** - when tapping "Book Free Trial" in sticky bar, form positioning could be improved

These are cosmetic/UX polish items that could be addressed in a future phase.

## Gaps

[none - all tests passed]
