# Phase 2: CTA Placement - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Get the primary conversion action (Book Free Trial) visible above the fold and always accessible via a sticky CTA bar. Include click-to-call phone access. Form changes and content restructuring are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User delegated all design decisions to Claude. Research and plan based on mobile conversion best practices:

- **Hero CTA**: Button text, color, size, position within hero section
- **Sticky bar**: When it appears (scroll threshold), what it contains, visual style, behavior
- **Phone number**: Click-to-call placement, visibility, formatting
- **Animations/transitions**: How sticky bar enters/exits, any motion effects

Guidelines to follow during implementation:
- Prioritize conversion (clear, high-contrast CTAs)
- Mobile-first (thumb-friendly tap targets, readable text)
- Non-intrusive sticky bar (doesn't block content excessively)
- Fast (no heavy animations that impact performance)
