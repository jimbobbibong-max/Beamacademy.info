<objective>
Enhance conversion elements: ensure trust signals are prominent, CTA wording is consistent, stats are visible early, and visual hierarchy guides users to conversion.

Purpose: Optimize the conversion path while maintaining the editorial design aesthetic established in Phase 21.1.

Output: Page with optimized trust signal placement, consistent CTAs, and clear visual hierarchy.

Current conversion elements (from research):
- Primary CTA: "Get Your Free Diagnostic" used consistently
- Trust signals: Form has "95% improve" stat, testimonials in Trust section
- Stats: 95% improve, 2x 99.95 ATAR, 4 years experience mentioned

Research identified: Hero already has testimonial snippet, but trust signals could be more prominent near primary CTAs.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and verify CTA consistency</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Audit all CTAs on the page for consistency with the primary "Get Your Free Diagnostic" pattern.

1. Search for all CTA buttons and links. Expected locations:
   - Hero section: .btn-lime
   - Nav: .nav-cta
   - Pricing tiers: .tier-cta
   - Course cards: .course-btn
   - Sticky bar: .sticky-cta-button
   - Contact form: Submit button

2. Verify wording is consistent:
   - Primary CTAs should say "Get Your Free Diagnostic" or "Get My Free Diagnostic"
   - Nav CTA can say "Book Free Diagnostic" (shorter for space)
   
3. If any CTAs have different wording (e.g., "Get Started", "Book Now", "Learn More"), update to the standard pattern.

4. Verify secondary CTAs are visually subordinate:
   - Should have transparent/outline style, not filled
   - Should NOT compete with primary CTA for attention

WHY: Research Pitfall 5 flagged CTA text inconsistency. Consistent messaging reduces friction.
  </action>
  <verify>
Search page source for all CTA buttons:
- All primary CTAs say "Get Your/My Free Diagnostic"
- No competing CTA variants like "Book Now" or "Get Started"
- Secondary CTAs (login, links) are visually subordinate
  </verify>
  <done>All CTAs follow consistent "Get Your Free Diagnostic" pattern.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance trust signal prominence near hero CTA</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Ensure at least one trust signal is visible near the hero CTA to reinforce credibility at the point of action.

1. Check if hero section already has a trust element near the CTA. Current state has:
   - hero-testimonial snippet below buttons
   - This should be sufficient

2. If the trust signal is below the fold on mobile, consider:
   - Adding a small inline trust badge (e.g., "5.0 ★ | 95% improve") next to or below the CTA
   - Keep it subtle - one line max

3. Verify the form trust-signal element is prominent:
   - Current: form-trust-signal with "5.0 ★" and "95% of students improve"
   - Ensure this is visible without scrolling within the form area

4. Do NOT add excessive trust signals - one near hero CTA, one in form is sufficient.

WHY: Research Pitfall 4 flagged trust signals below the fold. Key credibility indicators should be near conversion points.
  </action>
  <verify>
On mobile (375px):
- Hero section shows trust element (testimonial or badge) within first viewport or just below CTA
- Contact form shows trust signal visible when form is in view
- No more than 2 prominent trust signals visible at any time (avoid clutter)
  </verify>
  <done>Trust signals are prominently placed near CTAs without visual clutter.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify visual hierarchy guides to CTA</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Ensure visual hierarchy naturally guides users toward CTAs through:

1. Verify section-cta links exist and are visually consistent:
   - Each major section (Proof, Comparison, Trust) should have a subtle link to Contact
   - These should be text links with arrow, not competing buttons

2. Verify primary CTA has strongest visual weight:
   - .btn-lime should have the purple glow shadow (established in 21.1)
   - Other buttons should be visually subordinate

3. Check the eye flow pattern:
   - Hero: Title -> Subtitle -> CTA (purple glow draws eye)
   - Sections: Content -> Supporting CTA link (subtle)
   - Form: Fields -> Trust signal -> Submit button

4. If any section lacks a CTA link, add one:
   - Pattern: <a href="#contact" class="section-cta">Get Your Free Diagnostic <span aria-hidden="true">→</span></a>
   - Only if genuinely missing - don't add redundant CTAs

WHY: CONV-04 requires clear visual hierarchy. The purple glow from 21.1 creates CTA prominence; section links maintain conversion path.
  </action>
  <verify>
Visual inspection:
- Primary CTAs (hero, pricing tiers) have purple glow and stand out
- Section CTAs are subtle text links, not competing buttons
- Eye naturally flows from content to CTA in each section
- No visual clutter or competing calls-to-action
  </verify>
  <done>Visual hierarchy clearly guides users through content to conversion points.</done>
</task>
