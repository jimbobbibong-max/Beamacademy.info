# Phase 22: Layout, Mobile & Conversion - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Apply intentional spatial composition (asymmetric/bold layouts where appropriate), ensure mobile excellence (tap targets, sticky CTA, forms), and optimize conversion elements (trust signals, CTAs). This builds on the design system from Phase 21.1.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User granted full discretion for all Phase 22 areas. Research and decide based on:

**Section Layouts**
- Which sections benefit from asymmetric/grid-breaking treatment
- Balance between editorial boldness and clarity
- Intentional whitespace and visual hierarchy

**Mobile Experience**
- Sticky CTA implementation (behavior, timing, visibility)
- Tap target sizing and spacing (44px minimum, context-aware)
- Form optimization for mobile input
- Touch-friendly interactions

**Trust Signals & Social Proof**
- Optimal placement of testimonials
- Partner/client logos treatment
- Stats/numbers presentation
- Review/rating integration if appropriate

**CTA Strategy**
- Primary vs secondary CTA distinction
- Action wording and microcopy
- Visual treatment (purple glow established in 21.1)
- Urgency/scarcity if appropriate

**Guiding Principles:**
- Apply Frontend Design Skill aesthetic (bold, intentional, grid-breaking where effective)
- Maintain BEAM brand (purple-first, hard colors, professional tutoring vibe)
- Mobile-first but desktop-excellent
- Conversion without being pushy

</decisions>
