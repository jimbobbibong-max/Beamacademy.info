# Phase 9: Trust Section - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Build credibility through tutor profiles and social proof. Section must drive visitors toward free trial conversion. Includes: tutor profiles with photos and credentials, parent testimonials with specific outcomes, group size callout, and school-specific matching mention.

## Implementation Decisions

### Tutor presentation
- Show 2-3 tutors (focused showcase, less scrolling)
- Real headshots available (professional quality)
- All tutors are Baulko graduates — emphasize this shared credential
- Emphasize the "trifecta": selective school + high HSC scores + current uni/professional study

### Credentials to display
- **Chris Kim**: 97 Maths Ext1, 93 Maths Ext2, 95 Physics, 98th percentile UCAT, Medicine @ Newcastle
- **Nathan You**: 95 Maths Ext1, 95 Maths Ext2, 99th percentile UCAT, Medicine @ Newcastle
- **Taehoon Kim**: 95 Maths Ext1, 1540 SAT, 4 years tutoring experience, Optometry @ UNSW
- **John Park**: 95 English Adv, 96 Maths Ext1, 96 Maths Ext2
- Select 2-3 from above based on which credentials are most compelling

### Testimonials
- Parent testimonials with specific score improvements are available (2+)
- Research should determine: best format for testimonial display (quote style, attribution level)
- Current student testimonials exist but lack specific outcomes — prioritize parent testimonials with numbers

### Trust signals
- "Max 6-8 students" group size must be prominently visible
- School-specific matching mentioned (Baulko vs James Ruse formats)
- All tutors from Baulkham Hills High School — social proof of selective school pipeline

### Claude's Discretion
- Layout and visual hierarchy (profiles first vs testimonials first)
- Card design and styling
- How to present UCAT scores (percentile format, prominence)
- How to handle tutors with different credential strengths (some have UCAT, some have SAT, etc.)
- Section order optimization for conversion

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Highest priority is driving free trial form submissions
- Comprehensive research needed on trust section best practices for conversion
- The "Baulko + 95%+ HSC + Medicine/Professional study" trifecta is the key differentiator
- Chris has 98%tile UCAT (additional credential not currently on site)
- All existing tutor data is in index.html team section (lines 6019-6067)
