Update the Courses & Pricing section header with outcome-focused headline and risk reversal language.

Purpose: Replace generic "Invest in Your Future" headline with outcome-focused copy that ties to BEAM's diagnostic value prop. Add explicit risk reversal in description to reduce friction.

Output: Updated section header in beamacademy-index.html

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update section headline and description</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Find the section header around lines 5779-5784 and make these replacements:

    **Replace headline (line 5781):**
    OLD: `<h2 class="section-title" id="courses-title">Invest in Your Future</h2>`
    NEW: `<h2 class="section-title" id="courses-title">See Exactly Where Your Child Needs Help</h2>`

    **Replace description (lines 5782-5784):**
    OLD:
    ```html
    <p class="section-description">
        Transparent pricing with multi-subject discounts. Maximum 8 students per class. Your first lesson is always free.
    </p>
    ```
    NEW:
    ```html
    <p class="section-description">
        Transparent pricing with multi-subject discounts. Maximum 8 students per class.<br>
        <strong>No payment required. No obligation.</strong> Your free diagnostic is yours to keep.
    </p>
    ```

    Key changes:
    - Headline: Generic → outcome-focused (ties to diagnostic value prop)
    - Description: Weak risk reversal → explicit "No payment required. No obligation."
    - Added `<br>` for visual separation of the risk reversal line
    - Bold emphasis on risk reversal with `<strong>` tags
