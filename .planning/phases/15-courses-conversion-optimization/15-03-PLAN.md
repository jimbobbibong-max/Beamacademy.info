<objective>
Document the dark theme decision for the Courses section (no code changes).

Purpose: The research recommended keeping the dark theme for visual hierarchy and premium feel. This plan documents that decision in project files so it's tracked and the "Theme Decision" blocker is resolved.

Output: Updated ROADMAP.md and STATE.md with documented decision

    1. In the "Recent Decisions" table, add a new row:
       | 2026-01-23 | Keep dark theme for Courses section | Creates visual hierarchy, premium feel, helps CTAs pop |

    2. In the "Blockers/Concerns" section, remove the theme decision blocker:
       OLD: "**Theme Decision:** Courses section is dark (gray-900) while rest of site is light. Need to decide if this is intentional visual hierarchy or jarring inconsistency."
       NEW: "None currently."

    3. Update "Current Position" section:
       - Phase: 15 of 15 - Courses Section Conversion Optimization
       - Status: IN PROGRESS (or EXECUTING if plans are being run)
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Read STATE.md
    2. Confirm "Keep dark theme" decision is in Recent Decisions table
    3. Confirm Blockers/Concerns shows "None currently"

    In the Phase 15 section, update the scope to show theme decision is resolved:

    **Update Scope section to add resolution:**
    Under "Scope (from FEATURES.md research):", update the first item:
    OLD: "- Theme consistency decision (dark section vs light site flow)"
    NEW: "- Theme consistency decision: **KEEP DARK** (visual hierarchy, premium feel)"

    This documents that the decision was made without needing code changes.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Read ROADMAP.md Phase 15 section
    2. Confirm theme decision shows "KEEP DARK" with rationale
  </verify>
  <done>
    - ROADMAP.md documents theme decision as resolved
    - Rationale captured inline
  </done>
