# Phase 26: Pages Audit & Creation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Audit the BEAM Academy site for additional pages needed, then create them using Frontend Design Skill aesthetic with BEAM brand (purples, pastels). Focus on trust/credibility building and SEO/discovery. This phase includes a design refinement pass for the purple/pastel color execution.

## Implementation Decisions

### Page Scope & Priority
- Audit site first to determine which pages are missing (don't assume)
- Purpose: Trust & credibility + SEO & discovery (both)
- No exclusions — open to whatever audit suggests
- Page count determined by audit findings

### Content Depth & Structure
- Tutor profiles: Summary cards (photo, name, key credentials, subjects taught)
- Results/testimonials: Quote cards with scores (student quote + score improvement + subject + photo if available)
- Location/contact: Map + basics (address, embedded map, phone, email) — clean and simple
- Every page ends with consistent CTA ("Start Trial" or "Book Consultation")

### Visual Approach
- Hero style: Varies by page (Claude decides what fits each page's content)
- Real tutor photos are available for use
- Section backgrounds: Claude decides per page
- Gold accent (#f59e0b): Keep for trust signals and highlights
- **Purple/pastel refinement required** — current execution not satisfactory

### Design Reference
- **Exert Education website** — key reference for:
  - Overall polish
  - Color usage
  - Layout/spacing
  - General quality bar
- Approach: Comprehensive research of Exert + competitors BEFORE building, then refine purple/pastel execution while creating pages

### Navigation & Linking
- Header nav: Selective additions (essential pages only, others in footer)
- URL structure: Simple paths (/about, /results, /contact)
- Mobile nav organization: Claude decides based on page count
- Cross-linking: Yes, contextual links between pages where natural

### Claude's Discretion
- Which pages to build (based on audit)
- Page count (based on audit findings)
- Hero treatment per page
- Section background variations
- Mobile nav structure
- Internal linking strategy
- Purple/pastel color refinement approach
- Most implementation details — user wants comprehensive research and autonomous decision-making

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Exert Education did their website quite well" — use as quality benchmark
- Current purple/pastel execution "can be much better"
- Summary card format preferred over long-form content
- Simple, clean approach for contact/location info
