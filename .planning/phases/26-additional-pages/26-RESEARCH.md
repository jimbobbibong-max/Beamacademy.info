# Phase 26: Pages Audit & Creation - Research

**Researched:** 2026-01-31
**Domain:** Tutoring website page structure, purple color execution, trust-building patterns
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (composite - some areas HIGH, some LOW due to limited Exert Education access)

## Summary

Research investigated three key areas: (1) what pages a tutoring website needs beyond the landing page, (2) how competitor tutoring sites structure their pages, and (3) how to execute purple/gold color schemes effectively for a premium, trustworthy feel.

**Key findings:**
- Tutoring websites universally need: About/Team, Results/Testimonials, Contact pages as minimum
- The most effective tutoring sites use summary cards for tutors (photo, credentials, subjects) rather than lengthy bios
- Purple + gold is a proven luxury/trust combination; purple works best as accent against white/neutral backgrounds rather than dominant
- Gold (#f59e0b) as a 10% accent breaks purple monotony and adds warmth/trust signals

**Primary recommendation:** Create 3 core pages (About/Tutors, Results, Contact) using summary card patterns with purple as accent color and gold for trust highlights, maintaining generous white space.

## Page Audit: What's Missing

### Current BEAM Site Pages
| Page | Status | URL |
|------|--------|-----|
| Homepage | EXISTS | index.html |
| Mathematics | EXISTS | mathematics.html |
| English | EXISTS | english.html |
| Physics | EXISTS | physics.html |
| Chemistry | EXISTS | chemistry.html |
| Privacy Policy | EXISTS | privacy.html |
| Terms | EXISTS | terms.html |
| Refund Policy | EXISTS | refund.html |

| 404 | EXISTS | 404.html |

### Missing Critical Pages
| Page | Priority | Purpose | SEO Value |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **About/Our Tutors** | HIGH | Trust & credibility - who are these people? | Medium |
| **Results/Testimonials** | HIGH | Social proof - does this work? | High |
| **Contact** | HIGH | Conversion - how do I reach them? | Medium |
| FAQ | MEDIUM | Reduce friction - answer common questions | High (featured snippets) |

**Confidence: HIGH** - Cross-verified across multiple tutoring website guides ([HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/tutoring-website-examples), [TutorCruncher](https://tutorcruncher.com/blog/how-to-make-a-tutoring-website), [Zarla](https://www.zarla.com/guides/tutoring-website-examples))

## Exert Education Analysis

**Source:** Direct website fetch of exerteducation.com.au
**Confidence: LOW** - Could only access structured data/metadata, not visual design

### What We Know
- **Location:** Suite 406, Epping, NSW (same suburb as BEAM)
- **Services:** Mathematics (Years 9-12), Chemistry (Years 11-12)
- **Hours:** Weekdays 3-10 PM, Saturday 9 AM-5 PM
- **Positioning:** "Premier HSC tutoring centre" with "refined education system"
- **Social:** Active Instagram and Facebook presence
- **Contact:** Phone and email prominently available

### Design Observations (Limited)
- Professional schema markup implementation (indicates technical competence)
- No visible tutor profiles in schema data
- No testimonials in structured data
- Focus on institutional credibility over individual tutor spotlight

### Gap Identified
Could not visually analyze Exert's color usage, layout patterns, or spacing. **Recommendation:** User may want to manually review Exert's visual design during planning phase.

## Competitor Patterns

### Matrix Education (matrix.edu.au)
**Confidence: MEDIUM**
- **Color scheme:** Maroon (#481e2a) primary, red (#eb0909) CTAs, light grey accents
- **Navigation:** Sophisticated two-level dropdowns by course category
- **Approach:** Institutional brand focus over individual tutors
- **Notable:** Purple-to-pink and orange-to-red gradients for decorative elements

### Dymocks Tutoring (dymockstutoring.edu.au)
**Confidence: MEDIUM**
- **Color scheme:** Red (#E31936) primary, dark navy (#0f0e17), cyan accents (#87cad5)
- **Tutor display:** Carousel with circular photos, grayscale-to-color on hover
- **Trust signals:** "97% success rate", "1500+ students", Google Reviews integration
- **Results:** Multiple locations with schema markup
- **Contact:** Unified 1300 number across locations

### Common Patterns Across Competitors
| Element | Standard Implementation |
|---------|------------------------|
| Hero | Strong value proposition, immediate CTA |
| Services | Organized by year level or subject |
| Tutors | Summary cards or carousel |
| Trust | Success rate stats, student counts, reviews |
| CTA | Consistent across all pages, above and below fold |
| Footer | Extensive links, contact info, social |

## Best Practices by Page Type

### About/Team Page
**Confidence: HIGH** - Verified across multiple sources

**Essential elements:**
1. Brief company story (2-3 paragraphs max)
2. Tutor summary cards with:
   - Professional photo (real, not stock)
   - Name
   - Key credentials (degrees, HSC scores, experience)
   - Subjects taught
3. Teaching philosophy/approach (brief)
4. Trust credentials (school affiliations, results)

**Layout pattern:**
```
Hero: "Meet Our Tutors" + brief tagline
Section 1: Brief story (why BEAM exists)
Section 2: Tutor cards grid (2-3 per row desktop, 1 on mobile)
Section 3: Teaching approach/philosophy
CTA: Consistent site CTA
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Long biographical essays (use summary cards)
- Stock photos (kills trust instantly)
- Hiding credentials (be specific about HSC scores, degrees)

### Results/Testimonials Page
**Confidence: HIGH**

**Essential elements:**
1. Headline metrics (aggregate stats)
2. Individual testimonial cards with:
   - Student quote
   - Score improvement (before/after or final score)
   - Subject area
   - Student photo (if available) or first name + school year
3. Optional: Case study format for standout results

**Layout pattern:**
```
Hero: Bold headline ("Our Students Excel") + key stat
Section 1: 3-4 headline metrics in cards
Section 2: Testimonial grid/masonry
Section 3: (Optional) Detailed case study
CTA: Consistent site CTA
```

**Trust signal ideas:**
- Specific scores (not vague "improved")
- Before/after comparisons
- School names (with permission)
- Time period of improvement

### Contact Page
**Confidence: HIGH**

**Essential elements:**
1. Multiple contact methods (phone, email, form)
2. Physical address with embedded map
3. Operating hours
4. Response time expectation

**Layout pattern:**
```
Hero: "Get in Touch" + brief message
Section 1: Contact methods (phone CTA prominent)
Section 2: Embedded Google Map
Section 3: Simple contact form (name, email, message, optional phone)
Footer: Operating hours, address
```

**Best practices:**
- Phone number should be clickable (tel: link)
- Form should be simple (3-5 fields max)
- Map should be interactive but not overwhelming
- Include operating hours near contact info

## Purple/Pastel Color Execution

### The Problem with Current BEAM Execution
Per CONTEXT.md: "Purple/pastel execution not satisfactory" and "can be much better"

### Research Findings on Purple
**Confidence: MEDIUM** - Aggregated from [99designs](https://99designs.com/inspiration/websites/purple), [iColorPalette](https://icolorpalette.com/purple-and-gold)

**Why purple works:**
- Signals creativity, luxury, wisdom, sophistication
- Combines energy of red with calm of blue
- Associated with innovation (Twitch, Yahoo)
- Works for education and premium services

**Why purple fails:**
- When overused as dominant color (overwhelming)
- Without enough white space (claustrophobic)
- With wrong accent colors (muddy)
- In gradients (can look dated or cheap)

### Effective Purple Approaches

**1. Purple as Accent, Not Dominant**
- Use purple for: headlines, CTAs, icons, borders, highlights
- Use white/neutral for: backgrounds, body text containers
- Ratio: 60% white/neutral, 30% purple accents, 10% warm accent

**2. Purple + Gold Combination**
- Gold (#f59e0b) pairs elegantly with purple for luxury feel
- Gold adds warmth and trust signals
- Use gold sparingly: trust badges, star ratings, achievement highlights
- Avoid: gold on purple directly (use on white backgrounds)

**Recommended palette refinement:**
```css
/* Primary purple - use for key accents */
--purple-700: #7c3aed;  /* CTAs, headlines, icons */

/* Supporting purples - use sparingly */
--purple-100: #f3e8ff;  /* Light backgrounds */
--purple-50: #faf5ff;   /* Very subtle backgrounds */

/* Trust accent - use at 10% ratio */
--accent-warm: #f59e0b; /* Stars, badges, highlights */

/* Neutral dominance */
--white: #ffffff;       /* Primary background */
--gray-50: #fafafa;     /* Section backgrounds */
--gray-800: #27272a;    /* Body text */
```

**3. Pattern: Purple Islands on White Sea**
Instead of purple sections, create "islands" of purple:
- Purple-bordered cards on white
- Purple icons/badges
- Purple text highlights
- White space as dominant visual element

### Examples of Effective Purple Execution
**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Site | Approach | What Works |
|------|----------|------------|
| Auth0 | Purple accents on light backgrounds | Restrained, professional, tech-forward |
| Spendesk | Purple in cards, highlights, icons | Polished, modern, not overwhelming |
| IMO Health | Purple + green with custom illustrations | Innovative, approachable, healthcare trust |

### Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)
- Full purple backgrounds (except hero if well-balanced)
- Purple-on-purple gradients
- Purple body text on purple backgrounds
- Equal amounts of multiple bright colors
- Purple without sufficient white space

## Page-Specific Hero Recommendations

Based on CONTEXT.md decision: "Hero style varies by page (Claude decides)"

| Page | Hero Style | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| About/Tutors | Photo collage or team image + headline | Personal, humanizing |
| Results | Bold stat headline + subtle background | Data-forward, impressive |
| Contact | Simple headline + location visual | Functional, inviting |

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Google Maps embed | Custom map solution | Google Maps iframe | Familiar UX, maintained |
| Testimonial carousel | Custom JS slider | CSS-only grid or simple JS | Carousels have poor engagement |
| Contact form | Custom backend | Netlify Forms (already on Netlify) | Free, built-in, spam protection |
| Image gallery | Custom lightbox | Native lazy loading + simple grid | Performance, simplicity |

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Stock Photo Team Pages
**What goes wrong:** Using generic stock photos destroys trust instantly
**Why it happens:** Real photos not available or seem "unprofessional"
**How to avoid:** Use real tutor photos (CONTEXT.md confirms available)
**Warning signs:** Tutors look like models, inconsistent photo styles

### Pitfall 2: Wall of Text About Page
**What goes wrong:** Visitors bounce before finding key info
**Why it happens:** Trying to tell entire company story
**How to avoid:** Summary cards, scannable layout, key facts prominent
**Warning signs:** Paragraphs longer than 3-4 sentences

### Pitfall 3: Hidden Contact Information
**What goes wrong:** Conversion drops, frustration increases
**Why it happens:** Contact page not in main nav, buried info
**How to avoid:** Contact in header nav, phone prominent everywhere
**Warning signs:** Multiple clicks needed to find phone number

### Pitfall 4: Purple Overload
**What goes wrong:** Site feels heavy, overwhelming, cheap
**Why it happens:** Using purple as primary background color throughout
**How to avoid:** Purple as accent only, white space dominant
**Warning signs:** More purple than white visible on any screen

### Pitfall 5: Vague Testimonials
**What goes wrong:** No credibility, could be fake
**Why it happens:** Not asking for specific details
**How to avoid:** Include scores, timeframes, specific improvements
**Warning signs:** "Great tutor!" without specifics

## Code Examples

### Tutor Card Pattern
```html
<!-- Summary card format from CONTEXT.md decision -->
<article class="tutor-card">
  <img src="tutor-photo.jpg" alt="[Name], [Subject] Tutor" class="tutor-photo">

  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
}

.accent-card:hover {
  border-color: var(--purple-400);
}
```

## Navigation Recommendations

Based on CONTEXT.md: "Header nav: Selective additions (essential pages only, others in footer)"

### Header Navigation
```
Logo | Subjects (dropdown) | About Us | Results | Contact | [CTA Button]
```

### Footer Navigation
```
Subjects: Mathematics | English | Physics | Chemistry
Company: About Us | Results | Contact
Legal: Privacy Policy | Terms | Refund Policy
```

### Mobile Navigation
- Hamburger menu with all pages
- Subjects as expandable section
- CTA button always visible

## Recommended Build Order

Based on trust-building priority and dependency:

1. **About/Tutors page** (FIRST)
   - Establishes credibility
   - Content: Real photos + credentials available
   - No dependencies

2. **Results page** (SECOND)
   - Social proof
   - Content: Testimonials + scores needed
   - Can link to About for tutor context

3. **Contact page** (THIRD)
   - Conversion path
   - Content: Address + map already in schema
   - Links back to all other pages

4. **(Optional) FAQ page**
   - If time permits
   - Good for SEO, reduces support load

## Open Questions

1. **Tutor photos:** Are all tutor photos available and consistent quality?
   - What we know: CONTEXT.md says "real tutor photos available"
   - What's unclear: Format, quality, number of tutors
   - Recommendation: Verify assets before building

2. **Testimonial content:** Are specific scores and quotes available?
   - What we know: User wants "quote cards with scores"
   - What's unclear: How many testimonials, specific data
   - Recommendation: Gather 6-10 testimonials with scores before building

3. **Exert Education visual design:** Could not fully analyze
   - What we know: Metadata only
   - What's unclear: Actual color usage, spacing, layout
   - Recommendation: User manual review if important as benchmark
