<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update Homepage Navigation</name>
  <files>Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Update the main homepage navigation:

1. **Header Navigation (.nav-links):**
   Current structure:
   - Courses and Pricing (#courses)
   - FAQ (#faq)
   - Pay Now (#contact)
   - Free Diagnostic (#contact)

   New structure (add new pages, keep essentials):
   - About Us (about.html)
   - Results (results.html)
   - Courses and Pricing (#courses)
   - Contact (contact.html)
   - Free Diagnostic (#contact) - keep as primary CTA

   Implementation:
   - Add About Us link: href="about.html" class="nav-link"
   - Add Results link: href="results.html" class="nav-link"
   - Move or keep Contact as header link
   - Keep Pay Now in a logical place (could be secondary CTA or dropdown)

2. **Mobile Navigation (.mobile-nav-links):**
   Update to match header nav:
   - About Us
   - Results
   - Courses and Pricing
   - Contact
   - Pay Now
   - Get Your Free Diagnostic (primary CTA at bottom)

3. **Footer Navigation:**
   Update "Quick Links" column to include:
   - About Us (about.html)
   - Results (results.html)
   - Contact (contact.html)
   - Courses and Pricing (#courses)
   - Pay Now (#contact)
   - Student Portal (existing link)

4. **Do NOT break:**
   - Existing anchor links (#courses, #faq, #contact)
   - Pay Now functionality
   - Student Portal link
   - Sticky CTA behavior
  </action>
  <verify>
New nav links exist:
- grep -c "about.html" Downloads/beamacademy-index.html returns at least 2 (header + footer)
- grep -c "results.html" Downloads/beamacademy-index.html returns at least 2
- grep -c "contact.html" Downloads/beamacademy-index.html returns at least 2
Existing links preserved:
- grep -c "#courses" Downloads/beamacademy-index.html returns at least 1
  </verify>
  <done>Homepage navigation updated with links to all new pages</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify and Update New Page Navigation</name>
  <files>about.html, results.html, contact.html</files>
  <action>
Ensure consistent navigation across all new pages:

1. **Header Navigation (all new pages):**
   Verify each page has:
   - Logo linking to index.html (not # or /)
   - About Us (about.html) - mark as active on about.html
   - Results (results.html) - mark as active on results.html
   - Courses and Pricing (index.html#courses)
   - Contact (contact.html) - mark as active on contact.html
   - Free Diagnostic CTA (index.html#contact)

   Active state implementation:
   - Add class="nav-link active" to current page
   - Style .nav-link.active with purple color or underline

2. **Mobile Navigation (all new pages):**
   Same links as header, ensure mobile nav toggle works

3. **Footer Navigation (all new pages):**
   Identical footer structure across all pages:
   - Quick Links: About Us, Results, Contact, Courses and Pricing, Pay Now, Student Portal
   - Subjects: Mathematics, English, Chemistry, Physics
   - Contact: Phone, Email, Address
   - Legal: Privacy, Terms, Refund

4. **Logo Behavior:**
   - Logo on new pages should link to index.html
   - Logo on index.html can link to # (scroll to top)

5. **Cross-linking opportunities:**
   - About page: "See our results" link to results.html
   - Results page: "Meet our tutors" link to about.html
   - Results page: "Contact us to get started" link to contact.html
   - Contact page: "Learn about our tutors" link to about.html
  </action>
  <verify>
Navigation consistent:
- grep -c "about.html" about.html returns at least 1 (logo or nav)
- grep -c "results.html" about.html returns at least 2 (nav + cross-link)
- grep -c "index.html" about.html returns at least 3 (logo + nav + CTA)
Active states:
- grep -c "active" about.html returns at least 1
  </verify>
  <done>All new pages have consistent navigation with proper active states</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Final Verification and Polish</name>
  <files>Downloads/beamacademy-index.html, about.html, results.html, contact.html</files>
  <action>
Final verification and cleanup:

1. **Link Verification:**
   Test all links work correctly (no broken links):
   - about.html exists and is valid
   - results.html exists and is valid
   - contact.html exists and is valid
   - All anchor links (#courses, #faq, #contact) work on homepage

2. **Navigation Consistency Audit:**
   Compare navigation HTML across all 4 pages:
   - Header nav structure identical (except active class)
   - Footer structure identical
   - Mobile nav structure identical

3. **Active State Styling:**
   Add CSS for active navigation state if not present:
   - .nav-link.active should have visual indicator
   - Could be: color change, underline, or background

4. **Mobile Menu Behavior:**
   Verify mobile menu works on all pages:
   - Toggle button opens/closes menu
   - Links navigate correctly
   - Menu closes when link clicked

5. **Breadcrumb consideration (optional):**
   If space permits, add simple breadcrumb on inner pages:
   - Home > About Us
   - Home > Results
   - Home > Contact

6. **404 Page Update (if exists):**
   If 404.html exists, update its navigation to match

7. **Subject Pages Update:**
   Update navigation on subject pages (mathematics.html, english.html, etc.) to include new pages:
   - Add About Us, Results, Contact to their header nav
   - Update their footers
  </action>
  <verify>
All files exist:
- ls -la about.html results.html contact.html
Links work (file references exist):
- grep -l "about.html" Downloads/beamacademy-index.html about.html results.html contact.html | wc -l should be 4
Consistent structure:
- grep -c "footer-content" Downloads/beamacademy-index.html about.html results.html contact.html returns same number for each
  </verify>
  <done>Navigation fully consistent across all pages, all links verified working</done>
</task>

</tasks>
