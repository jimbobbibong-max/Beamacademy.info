## This Session
- Diagnosed state mismatch: planning docs said Phase 5 done, but code was reverted
- Re-executed all 4 Phase 5 plans using safe sed commands:
  - 05-01: GTM preconnect, hero preload, fetchpriority, image dimensions
  - 05-02: Async Google Fonts (preload+onload pattern)
  - 05-03: aria-hidden → inert on sticky CTA bar
  - 05-04: Logo lazy loading + dimensions
- Verified no corruption (0 `??` markers, Unicode intact, tags balanced)
- Tested locally on http://localhost:3000 - working
- Cleaned up index.html.backup and index.html.corrupted
- Pushed 22 commits to main (deployed to Netlify)

## Full v1 Milestone
- Phase 1: Emergency Viewport Fix ✓
- Phase 2: CTA Placement ✓
- Phase 3: Form Optimization ✓
- Phase 4: Content Structure ✓

<remaining_work>
## v1 Complete - No remaining work for this milestone

## Pending Polish (deferred)
2 todos in `.planning/todos/pending/`:
- Fix skip to main content button styling
- Improve form scroll anchor position

## v2 Ideas (from PROJECT.md)
- Multi-step form wizard
- A/B testing framework
- Exit-intent popup
- Google Reviews widget
- Video testimonial
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Used `sed` for all HTML edits to avoid UTF-8 corruption on Windows
- Changed sticky bar from `aria-hidden` to `inert` attribute (better accessibility)
- Logo images use display dimensions (36x36) not file dimensions (854x788)
- Kept async font FOUT (flash of unstyled text) - acceptable tradeoff for performance
</decisions_made>

None - milestone complete and deployed.

<context>
Project started with 24 Google Ads clicks and 0 conversions due to broken mobile experience.
v1 redesign focused on mobile conversion optimization:
- Proper viewport/touch targets
- Always-visible CTAs (hero + sticky bar)
- Simplified 4-field form
- Performance (0.9s LCP, 0.014 CLS)

The corruption incident taught us to use sed instead of Edit/Write tools on Windows
for files with Unicode characters (emojis in CSS content properties).

Site is now live and ready to collect conversion data.
