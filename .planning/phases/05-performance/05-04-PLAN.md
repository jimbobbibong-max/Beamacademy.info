<objective>
Optimize logo image loading to reduce LCP interference

Purpose: The logo images (854x788 file displayed at 36x36) waste bandwidth and compete with the LCP hero image. Since we cannot resize the image without build tools, we can defer its loading.
Output: Logo images load lazily, reducing competition with hero image

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add lazy loading to logo images</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/beamacademy-site/index.html</files>
  <action>
  The logo images at lines 4562 and 5652 are decorative (aria-hidden="true") and sized at 854x788
  but displayed at only 36x36 CSS pixels. This wastes 12.1 KiB.

  Since we cannot resize the source file without build tools, add `loading="lazy"` to defer loading.
  The logo is visible in the header, but it's small (36x36) and decorative - the text "BEAM Academy"
  is the primary identifier. Lazy loading the image won't hurt UX.

  Line ~4562 (header logo):
  ```html
  <img src="logo-star.png" alt="" class="logo-img" aria-hidden="true" width="854" height="788" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
  ```

  Line ~5652 (footer logo):
  ```html
  <img src="logo-star.png" alt="" class="logo-img" aria-hidden="true" width="854" height="788" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
  ```

  Add both `loading="lazy"` AND `decoding="async"` to:
  1. Defer download until needed
  2. Decode on a separate thread to avoid blocking main thread
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Check both logo img tags have loading="lazy" and decoding="async"
  2. Verify logo still displays correctly in header and footer
  3. Network tab: logo should load later than hero image
  </verify>
  <done>Both logo images have loading="lazy" and decoding="async" attributes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Reduce logo display dimensions in HTML attributes</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/beamacademy-site/index.html</files>
  <action>
  The logo images have width="854" height="788" which is the file's actual dimensions.
  However, CSS displays them at 36x36px. Having accurate HTML dimensions helps CLS,
  but the browser still downloads the full file.

  Update the width/height attributes to match the CSS display size (36x36).
  This signals to the browser the intended display size and may help with resource prioritization.

  Change from:
  ```html
  width="854" height="788"
  ```

  Change to:
  ```html
  width="36" height="36"
  ```

  Note: The CSS already has `object-fit: contain` which will handle the aspect ratio correctly.
  The file is actually square-ish (854x788), and at 36x36 display it will be contain-fit.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Logo displays correctly at 36x36 in header and footer
  2. No layout shift when logo loads
  </verify>
  <done>Logo images have width="36" height="36" matching CSS display size</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. Both logo images have loading="lazy" decoding="async" attributes
2. Both logo images have width="36" height="36"
3. Logo displays correctly in header and footer
4. Network waterfall shows logo loading after hero image
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Logo images no longer compete with hero image for early loading
- Browser prioritizes hero image (the actual LCP element)
- No visual regression in logo appearance
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-performance/05-04-SUMMARY.md`

Note: The remaining LCP issue (3.2s vs 2.5s target) is primarily caused by:
1. Images not in WebP format (35 KiB savings) - requires build tools or manual conversion
2. Style & Layout 1,658ms - complex CSS processing
3. Google Tag Manager overhead

These cannot be fixed within the "static HTML, no build system" constraint.
If LCP target is critical, recommend:
- Manual image conversion to WebP using online tools
- CSS minification using online minifier
- Evaluate if GTM is necessary for the landing page
</output>
