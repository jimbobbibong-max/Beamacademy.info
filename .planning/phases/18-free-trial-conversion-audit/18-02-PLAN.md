<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Hero Section Optimization</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Optimize the hero section for 50ms clarity and 8-second conversion:

**Headline Optimization**
- Current: "Tutoring That Adapts to Their Weak Spots"
- Issue: Feature-focused, not outcome-focused
- Fix: Lead with OUTCOME (better grades, exam confidence) not feature (custom materials)
- Research: "What's in it for me" must be instant
- Suggested direction: Focus on student RESULTS not teaching METHOD

**Risk Reversal Addition**
- Current: Risk reversal only in small text below form
- Research: Risk reversal near CTA increases conversions
- Fix: Add "Free trial. No payment required." directly below or near hero CTA
- Make it visually connected to the CTA button

**CTA Copy Optimization**
- Current: "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
- Consider: First-person copy converts +90% ("Get MY Free Diagnostic")
- Ensure button has high contrast and is "loudest thing" above fold

**Social Proof Enhancement**
- Current: Small star rating + Luke K testimonial
- Research: Social proof in hero builds instant credibility
- Consider: More prominent placement or additional proof point
- Note: Don't clutter - one strong proof beats three weak ones

Implementation notes:
- Keep brand voice and colors consistent
- Test changes in browser before finalizing
- Ensure mobile view still works with any additions
  </action>
  <verify>Hero section has outcome-focused headline, visible risk reversal near CTA, and optimized CTA copy</verify>
  <done>Hero optimized: clear value prop, risk reversal visible, CTA compelling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Strategic CTA Placement Throughout Page</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Add CTAs at natural decision points in the scroll journey:

**Research Foundation**
- CTAs above AND below fold
- Decision points: after showing value/proof
- Not too many (causes decision paralysis)
- Same primary CTA repeated, not multiple different actions

**Current CTA Inventory**
- Hero: 1 CTA
- Proof section: 0 CTAs (gap!)
- Comparison section: 0 CTAs (gap!)
- Trust section: 0 CTAs (gap!)
- Support section: 0 CTAs (gap!)
- Courses: Package selection (different conversion path)
- FAQ: 0 CTAs
- Contact: Form (destination)
- Final CTA section: 1 CTA
- Sticky/floating: Present

**Add CTAs At Decision Points**
After each major value section, add a soft CTA that doesn't disrupt flow:

1. **After Proof Section**
   - User just saw the 4 custom documents they'll receive
   - This is a natural "I want that" moment
   - Add: Link-style or subtle button "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
   - With risk reversal: "Free lesson. Keep the documents either way."

2. **After Comparison Section**
   - User just saw why BEAM is different
   - Add: Reinforcing CTA
   - Style: Can be text link or subtle button, doesn't need to be huge

3. **After Trust Section**
   - User just saw tutor credentials
   - Natural decision point
   - Add: CTA with "Meet our tutors in a free lesson" angle

**CTA Styling Notes**
- Don't make every section a hard sell
- Some can be text links, some buttons
- Consistent copy: "Get Your Free Diagnostic" or "Book Your Free Lesson"
- Always include risk reversal near each CTA

**Remove/Reduce Friction**
- Navigation: Consider simplifying or making section-only links
- External links: Keep "Student Portal" but ensure it doesn't compete with conversion
  </action>
  <verify>CTAs exist after Proof, Comparison, and Trust sections with risk reversal messaging</verify>
  <done>Strategic CTAs placed at 3+ decision points throughout scroll journey</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Navigation Simplification</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Optimize navigation to support rather than distract from conversion:

**Research Foundation**
- Removing navigation: up to +100% conversions (VWO study)
- Navigation gives visitors reasons NOT to convert
- For single-page landing, section links are acceptable
- External links compete with conversion goal

**Current Navigation Issues**
- "Student Portal" links externally (takes users away)
- "Pay Now" is secondary action competing with primary
- Multiple nav items split attention

**Navigation Optimization Strategy**
Option A (Recommended - Minimal):
1. Keep: Logo, Courses & Pricing, Free Diagnostic (primary CTA)
2. Move to footer or collapse: About, FAQ, Student Portal
3. Remove from main nav: Pay Now (existing students know where to go)

Option B (Conservative):
1. Keep all section links
2. Remove or deprioritize "Student Portal" link
3. Make "Free Diagnostic" more visually prominent

**Implementation**
- Choose one approach based on audit recommendations
- Ensure mobile nav is also updated
- Test: Navigation should feel simpler, not broken

**Mobile Navigation**
- Mobile users are 83% of traffic
- Simpler nav = faster to conversion
- Consider: Just logo + hamburger with CTA always visible

Implementation notes:
- Don't break existing functionality
- Footer should contain anything removed from nav
- Student Portal remains accessible, just less prominent
  </action>
  <verify>Navigation has fewer items or clearer hierarchy, external links deprioritized, primary CTA prominent</verify>
  <done>Navigation optimized to reduce distraction and emphasize conversion path</done>
</task>

After all tasks:
- [ ] Hero has outcome-focused headline
- [ ] Risk reversal visible near hero CTA
- [ ] CTAs exist after Proof section
- [ ] CTAs exist after Comparison section
- [ ] CTAs exist after Trust section
- [ ] Navigation simplified or hierarchy clarified
- [ ] Mobile navigation also updated
- [ ] Page still functions correctly (no broken links)

<success_criteria>
- Clear conversion path from hero to form
- Visitor never scrolls more than one section without seeing CTA opportunity
- Risk reversal messaging reinforces "no commitment" at every decision point
- Navigation supports rather than distracts from conversion goal
</success_criteria>
