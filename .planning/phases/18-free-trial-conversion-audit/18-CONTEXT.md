# Phase 18: Free Trial Conversion Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Holistic website audit focused on free trial form submissions. Analyze the COMPLETE site as an integrated conversion system — not section-by-section, but how everything meshes together. Conduct deep research, then provide integrated edits that optimize the full user journey toward trial signup.

This is an audit-then-implement phase: research → full-site analysis → integrated changes.

## Implementation Decisions

### Primary Conversion Goal
- Free trial form submissions — every element should ultimately drive toward filling out the trial form
- Single clear conversion target (not split across contact methods)

### Change Scope
- Full rethink allowed — major structural changes permitted if research supports it
- Not just polish/tune — can rework or remove elements that hurt conversion
- Think holistically, not incrementally

### Constraints
- Brand identity must stay: colors, logo, core messaging tone
- Layout, structure, content, flow — all changeable
- No sacred cows except brand

### Research Approach
- Mix of general CRO best practices AND tutoring/EdTech-specific patterns
- Sources: conversion optimization experts (CXL, CRO agencies, A/B case studies, landing page teardowns)
- Sources: EdTech/tutoring competitor analysis (how top services structure conversion funnels)
- Equal weighting between general principles and industry specifics

### Audit Method
- Full-site overview analysis, not section-by-section
- Evaluate how sections work together as a conversion system
- Identify friction points across the complete user journey
- Changes should be integrated, not isolated fixes

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific research sources and depth
- How to structure the audit findings
- Which changes to prioritize based on impact
- Implementation sequencing

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User wants this to be research-heavy — "a WHOLE FUCK TON of research"
- Emphasis on holistic view — how everything meshes together
- Forest view, not trees view
- Output should be integrated edits, not a list of section fixes

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
