<objective>
Conduct a comprehensive conversion audit of the BEAM Academy landing page, treating it as an integrated conversion funnel rather than isolated sections.

Purpose: Identify all barriers to free trial form submission and prioritize fixes by impact
Output: 18-AUDIT.md with specific, actionable findings that inform Wave 2 implementation plans

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Above-the-Fold Audit</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/18-free-trial-conversion-audit/18-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Analyze the hero section and above-fold experience against research benchmarks:

1. **50ms First Impression Test**
   - Can visitor understand "what, who, why" within 50ms?
   - Is value proposition scannable (not just readable)?
   - Current headline: "Tutoring That Adapts to Their Weak Spots"
   - Check: Does it lead with OUTCOME or feature?

2. **8-Second Decision Window**
   - Does above-fold answer: What is this? Who is it for? Why should I care?
   - Check hero description clarity and length
   - Is CTA visible without scrolling?

3. **CTA Analysis**
   - Current: Single "Get Your Free Diagnostic" button
   - Check: Contrast, size, copy action-orientation
   - Check: Is risk reversal ("No payment required") visible above fold?

4. **Social Proof**
   - Current: Star rating + Luke K testimonial
   - Check: Is this placed optimally or could move/expand?

5. **Navigation Impact**
   - Current: 6 nav links including external Student Portal
   - Research says: Navigation can reduce conversions up to 100%
   - Check: Do nav links distract from conversion goal?

Document specific issues with line numbers and research citations.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Full Conversion Path Audit</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/18-free-trial-conversion-audit/18-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Analyze the complete page as a conversion funnel (Hero -> Proof -> Comparison -> Trust -> Support -> About -> Courses -> FAQ -> Contact):

1. **Section Order Analysis**
   - Does order follow research-backed conversion flow?
   - Research shows: Value prop -> Proof -> Differentiation -> Trust -> CTA
   - Current order vs optimal order

2. **CTA Density and Placement**
   - Research: CTAs above AND below fold, at natural decision points
   - Current: Hero CTA, bottom CTA section, sticky bar, floating button
   - Check: Are there CTAs after Proof? After Comparison? After Trust?
   - Too many can hurt (-266%), too few loses opportunity

3. **Social Proof Positioning**
   - Research: Place near CTAs and at friction points, not buried at bottom
   - Current: Testimonial in hero, tutors in Trust, stats strip in Courses
   - Check: Is there social proof at pricing decision point?

4. **Form Placement**
   - Research: Above-fold form = +94% conversions, or use anchor link
   - Current: Form at very bottom in Contact section
   - Check: Is scroll distance a friction point?

5. **Content Length**
   - Research: 363 words optimal for education, 5th-7th grade reading level
   - Estimate current word count
   - Check readability level of key sections

6. **Trust Signals at Decision Points**
   - Research: Trust signals near pricing = +32%
   - Check: What signals appear near pricing/form?

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Priority Matrix and Recommendations</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/18-free-trial-conversion-audit/18-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Synthesize findings into prioritized, actionable recommendations:

1. **Impact Matrix**
   Create table rating each finding by:
   - Impact: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (based on research conversion lift data)
   - Effort: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (implementation complexity)
   - Priority: 1-5 (impact/effort score)

2. **Critical Fixes (Must Do)**
   List issues that research strongly indicates hurt conversions:
   - Missing risk reversal at key points
   - CTA gaps in scroll journey
   - Navigation distraction
   - Form placement friction

3. **High-Value Improvements**
   List changes with strong research backing:
   - Social proof repositioning
   - Copy simplification
   - Mobile-specific optimizations

4. **Consider/Test**
   List items with less certain impact:
   - Section reordering
   - Content reduction
   - Alternative CTA copy

5. **Implementation Groupings**
   Suggest how to bundle related fixes into coherent implementation plans:
   - Group 1: CTA and conversion path fixes
   - Group 2: Content and copy optimization
   - etc.

Format as markdown tables for clarity.
