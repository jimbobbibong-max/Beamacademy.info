<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Copy Simplification</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Simplify copy for faster comprehension and better conversion:

**Research Foundation**
- Education pages: 363 words optimal (lowest across industries)
- 5th-7th grade reading level: 11.1% conversion
- 8th-9th grade: 7.1% conversion
- Professional level: 5.3% conversion

**Key Sections to Review**
1. Hero description - must be scannable
2. Section descriptions - reduce complexity
3. About section - often too wordy
4. FAQ answers - simplify where possible

**Simplification Guidelines**
- Short sentences (under 20 words)
- Common words over jargon
- Active voice over passive
- Benefits over features
- "You/Your" over "We/Our"

**Hero Description**
Current: "We track scores topic by topic. Their worksheets target exactly what they need to improve."
- Good: Simple language
- Check: Could be even punchier

**Section Headers**
Review each section header:
- "See Exactly Where They're Struggling" - Good, outcome-focused
- "Not All Tutoring is the Same" - Good, differentiation
- "Tutors Who've Been There" - Good, trust
- "Stuck at 9pm? Help by 10am." - Good, benefit

**About Section**
Often verbose. Simplify to essential message.
What MUST be communicated:
- Who are the tutors (Baulko grads, 95%+ HSC)
- What makes BEAM different (tracking system)
- Where (Epping)

**Implementation Notes**
- Don't strip personality, strip complexity
- Read aloud - if it sounds stuffy, simplify
- Parents are busy - respect their time
  </action>
  <verify>Key sections have shorter, simpler sentences; no jargon; active voice</verify>
  <done>Copy simplified for 5th-7th grade reading level across key sections</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Social Proof Repositioning</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Reposition social proof to appear at decision points:

**Research Foundation**
- Social proof near CTAs: +34% conversions
- Star ratings near pricing: +270% conversions (Northwestern study)
- Photos with testimonials: Higher credibility
- Don't hide at bottom - use at friction points

**Current Social Proof Inventory**
1. Hero: Star rating (5.0) + Luke K testimonial
2. Trust section: Tutor cards with credentials
3. Courses section: Stats strip, testimonial below pricing
4. Contact: None

**Repositioning Strategy**

1. **Courses/Pricing Section**
   - Already has stats strip ("95% Improve", etc.) - good
   - Already has testimonial - good
   - Check: Is testimonial visible near pricing cards or buried?
   - Consider: Parent testimonial speaks to decision-maker

2. **Near Form/Contact**
   - Currently: No social proof
   - Research: Trust signals near form reduce abandonment
   - Add: Quick trust reminder
   - Options: "Join 100+ families", star rating recap, or mini-testimonial

3. **After Major Sections (with new CTAs)**
   - The CTAs added in Plan 02 could include micro proof
   - Example: "Join 95% of students who improve" near CTA

**Implementation Options**

Option A: Duplicate existing proof strategically
- Take stats strip elements and show smaller versions near form
- Add Google rating badge near form

Option B: Add new proof element near form
- Simple: "Join families from [School names]"
- Or: Compact testimonial snippet

Option C: Make existing proof more prominent
- Ensure testimonial in Courses isn't below the fold on mobile

**Notes**
- Don't overdo it - too much proof feels desperate
- Specific > generic ("95% improve" > "Trusted by many")
- Parent voice matters for decision-maker
  </action>
  <verify>Social proof element appears near form/contact section; testimonial visible near pricing on mobile</verify>
  <done>Social proof repositioned to decision points (pricing, form)</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Form and Mobile Optimization</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Optimize form for minimal friction and ensure mobile conversion path is smooth:

**Form Analysis**
Current fields: Name, Email (optional), Phone, Year Level (optional)
- Good: Only 4 fields, 2 optional
- Research: 11 to 4 fields = +120-160%
- Already optimized for field count

**Form Improvements**

1. **Clear "What Happens Next"**
   - Research: Reduces uncertainty, increases completion
   - Add after submit button: "We'll call within 24 hours to schedule your free lesson"
   - Or: "Next step: We'll text you to confirm a time"

2. **Strengthen Risk Reversal**
   - Current: "Your first lesson is free. No payment required today."
   - Good copy, ensure it's prominent
   - Check: Is it visible or lost in form clutter?

3. **Submit Button**
   - Current: "Get My Free Diagnostic"
   - Good: First-person, action-oriented
   - Ensure: High contrast, full width on mobile

**Mobile Optimization**

Research: 83% traffic is mobile, but converts 17.6% lower

1. **Thumb-Reachable CTAs**
   - Check: All CTAs in bottom 60% of screen on mobile
   - Sticky CTA bar exists - verify it's working

2. **Form on Mobile**
   - Single column (already done)
   - Large touch targets (44px min, already in CSS)
   - Check: Dropdown easy to use on touch

3. **Scroll Distance to Form**
   - Mobile users may not scroll to bottom
   - New CTAs from Plan 02 help
   - Ensure form anchor (#contact) scrolls correctly

4. **Loading Speed**
   - Current: LCP 0.9s, Performance 88/100 (good)
   - No action needed unless audit finds issues

**Implementation**
- Add "what happens next" text after submit button
- Verify risk reversal is visually prominent
- Test entire flow on mobile viewport
  </action>
  <verify>Form has "what happens next" messaging; mobile CTAs are accessible; form risk reversal is prominent</verify>
  <done>Form optimized with clear next steps and mobile experience verified</done>
</task>
