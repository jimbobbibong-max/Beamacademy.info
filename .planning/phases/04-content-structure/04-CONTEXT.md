# Phase 4: Content Structure - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Reorder page sections for optimal mobile conversion flow. Hero communicates value prop clearly, pricing displays without horizontal scroll, testimonials appear near the form, and hamburger menu works smoothly. This is about section ordering and content hierarchy — not adding new content or features.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User delegated all decisions to Claude — research best practices and implement optimal mobile conversion patterns.

**Areas to research and decide:**

1. **Section ordering** — What order maximizes conversion? Standard patterns for tutoring/service landing pages on mobile.

2. **Hero messaging** — How to communicate "tutoring for Years 7-12" value prop. Text hierarchy, emphasis, urgency cues.

3. **Pricing display** — How to present pricing on 320px screens without horizontal scroll. Stacking, simplification, or progressive disclosure.

4. **Testimonial placement** — Where testimonials should appear relative to the form. How many to show on mobile without overwhelming.

5. **Hamburger menu** — Smooth tap-to-open/close behavior. Standard mobile patterns.

**Constraints from success criteria:**
- Hero must communicate "tutoring for Years 7-12" clearly
- Pricing must not horizontal scroll on 320px
- At least one testimonial visible near/before form
- Hamburger menu must work smoothly

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — user wants best practices applied. Research mobile landing page conversion patterns for service businesses (tutoring, coaching, lessons).
