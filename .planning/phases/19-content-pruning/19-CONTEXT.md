# Phase 19: Content Pruning

## Goal
Systematic audit of what to REMOVE. Research minimalist landing page patterns, identify every element that doesn't directly support free trial conversion, cut ruthlessly.

## Why This Phase
Phase 18 audit was biased toward "what to add" not "what to remove". User instincts caught several cuts:
- About section (redundant)
- All Access $400/week banner (sticker shock)
- Class size commitments (business flexibility)

Need a formal "what to cut" pass with research backing.

## Research Areas
- Minimalist landing page case studies
- "Above the fold only" conversion patterns  
- What high-converting pages DON'T have
- Cognitive load reduction
- Decision fatigue prevention

## Success Criteria
- Every remaining element justified against conversion goal
- Page scroll depth reduced
- Cognitive load minimized
- No "nice to have" content - only "must have"
