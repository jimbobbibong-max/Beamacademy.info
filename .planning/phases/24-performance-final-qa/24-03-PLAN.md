Extract and document:
- Overall accessibility score (target: 90+)
- Passed audits count
- Failed audits (if any)
- Manual checks required

For each failed audit, document:
- Audit name
- Impact (critical/serious/moderate/minor)
- Elements affected
- Recommended fix

Document keyboard navigation test requirements for user to verify.

Add to 24-03-QA-RESULTS.md a Keyboard Navigation Test section:

Test Method: Press Tab repeatedly from top of page to bottom

Expected Tab Order:
1. Skip to content link (if present)
2. Navigation links
3. Hero CTA buttons
4. Form inputs (name, email, phone, etc.)
5. Submit button
6. Footer links

Checklist items:
- Can reach all interactive elements with Tab
- Focus indicator visible on all focused elements
- No keyboard traps (can Tab out of any element)
- Enter/Space activates buttons and links
- Escape closes modals (if applicable)
- Tab order is logical (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)

Note: This task prepares the checklist. User will verify in the checkpoint task.

  <files>.planning/phases/24-performance-final-qa/24-03-QA-RESULTS.md</files>
  <action>
Document how to test reduced motion preference and expected behavior.

Add to 24-03-QA-RESULTS.md a Reduced Motion Test section:

How to Enable Reduced Motion:

Windows: Settings → Ease of Access → Display → Show animations in Windows → OFF

macOS: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion → ON

Chrome DevTools (temporary):
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P
3. Type "Reduce motion"
4. Select "Emulate CSS prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"

Expected Behavior When Enabled:
- Page load animation does NOT play (content appears immediately)
- Scroll reveal animations do NOT play (sections visible immediately)
- Hover effects are instant (no transition animation)
- All transitions have duration: 0 or are disabled

CSS Implementation Check - verify this CSS exists:
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;

Please review and test the items in .planning/phases/24-performance-final-qa/24-03-QA-RESULTS.md

Key tests to perform:

1. Keyboard Navigation (takes ~2 min)
   - Press Tab from top to bottom of page
   - Verify focus ring visible on each element
   - Verify logical tab order

2. Reduced Motion (takes ~1 min)
   - Enable reduced motion in OS settings or DevTools
   - Refresh page - animations should NOT play
   - Hover buttons - should be instant, no transition

3. Final QA (takes ~5 min)
   - Click all CTAs
   - Submit test form
   - Check console for errors
   - Scroll entire page, check for visual issues

Classification:
- BLOCKER: Broken CTA, form, payment, keyboard trap, console errors
- FIX-LATER: Minor visual glitches, non-critical a11y issues
- PASS: Everything works as expected

Report your findings for each section.
