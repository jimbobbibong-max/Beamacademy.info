<current_state>
Wave 1 execution in progress. Both plans (24-01 and 24-02) have completed their automated tasks and are paused at human verification checkpoints.

- Plan 24-01: Tasks 1-3 complete, awaiting checkpoint at Task 4
- Plan 24-02: Task 1 complete, awaiting checkpoint at Task 2 (human browser testing)
</current_state>

<completed_work>
## Plan 24-01: Lighthouse Audit & Performance Verification
- Task 1: Run Lighthouse Desktop Audit - DONE (commit d1b6e45)
  - 3 runs completed, median scores: Performance 92, Accessibility 97, Best Practices 77
  - LCP: 1.5s (above 1.0s target but still in "Good" range)
  - CLS: 0.000 (excellent)
- Task 2: Run Lighthouse Mobile Audit - DONE
  - 3 runs completed, median scores: Performance 61, Accessibility 97
  - Mobile LCP: ~2.2s (throttled 4G simulation)
- Task 3: Verify Animation Performance - DONE
  - All Phase 23 animations use transform/opacity only (no layout thrashing)
  - PERF-04 requirement verified PASS

## Plan 24-02: Cross-Browser & Device Testing  
- Task 1: Create Browser Test Checklist - DONE (commit 8bb040b)
  - 24-02-BROWSER-RESULTS.md created with comprehensive checklist
  - Covers Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, iOS Safari, Android Chrome
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
## Wave 1 Checkpoints (parallel)
- Plan 24-01 Task 4: Human review of audit results
  - User needs to approve LCP at 1.5s (above 1.0s target but acceptable)
  - Or request fix tasks for LCP improvement
  
- Plan 24-02 Task 2-3: Human browser testing + documentation
  - User needs to test beamacademy.com.au in available browsers
  - Report PASS/FAIL/PASS(degraded) for each browser
  - Agent will document results in Task 3

## Wave 2 (after Wave 1 complete)
- Plan 24-03: Final Accessibility & QA Pass (5 tasks)
  - Lighthouse accessibility audit
  - Keyboard navigation testing
  - prefers-reduced-motion testing
  - Final QA checklist
  - v7 ship status determination
</remaining_work>

<audit_results_summary>
| Requirement | Target | Result | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| PERF-01: Desktop LCP | ≤1.0s | 1.5s | ⚠ Above target |
| PERF-02: CLS | ≤0.1 | 0.000 | ✓ PASS |
| PERF-03: Render-blocking | None | None | ✓ PASS |
| PERF-04: Animations | transform/opacity | All compliant | ✓ PASS |

Note: LCP bottleneck is element render delay (1239ms). Still in Google's "Good" range (<2.5s).

<agent_ids>
- Plan 24-01 executor: aea28c1 (can resume with this ID)
- Plan 24-02 executor: ae5f33f (can resume with this ID)
</agent_ids>

<decisions_made>
- Using lighthouse CLI with 3 runs each for statistical validity
- Accepting graceful degradation for @starting-style on older browsers
- Animation analysis done via CSS grep rather than runtime profiling
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None blocking - just awaiting human verification input
</blockers>

<context>
This is Phase 24, the final phase of v7 milestone. After this phase:
1. Phase goal verification runs
2. Milestone audit offered
3. v7 ships

The Wave 1 checkpoints need user to:
1. Review Lighthouse audit results and decide if 1.5s LCP is acceptable
2. Test the live site in multiple browsers and report results

After user provides both checkpoint responses, the executor agents can be resumed to complete their plans, then Wave 2 (24-03) can execute.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume orchestrator with `/gsd:resume-work`

User should provide checkpoint responses:
1. "Audit: approved" (or describe LCP concerns)
2. "Browsers: Chrome PASS, Firefox PASS, Edge PASS" (or actual results)

Then orchestrator will resume both agents with responses and continue execution.
</next_action>
