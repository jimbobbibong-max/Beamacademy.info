<current_state>
Wave 1 of Phase 24 is in progress. Both plans (24-01 and 24-02) hit checkpoints simultaneously and are awaiting user verification before completion.

- **24-01 (Lighthouse Audit):** 3/4 tasks complete, awaiting user approval of audit results
- **24-02 (Browser Testing):** 1/2 tasks complete, awaiting user to test browsers and report results
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## 24-01: Lighthouse Audit
- Task 1: Run Lighthouse Desktop Audit - ✓ Done (commit ac2ce71)
- Task 2: Run Lighthouse Mobile Audit - ✓ Done (commit ac2ce71)
- Task 3: Verify Animation Performance - ✓ Done (commit ac2ce71)
- Task 4: Review Audit Results - ⏸ Checkpoint reached

**Audit Results Created:** `.planning/phases/24-performance-final-qa/24-01-AUDIT-RESULTS.md`

**Key Findings:**
| Metric | Desktop | Mobile | Target | Verdict |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Performance | 92/100 | 61/100 | ≥70 | Desktop PASS |
| LCP | 1549ms | 5130ms | ≤1000ms | Desktop 1.5s (target was 1.0s) |
| CLS | 0.0003 | 0.0088 | ≤0.1 | PASS |
| Animations | Safe | Safe | transform/opacity only | PASS |

## 24-02: Browser Testing
- Task 1: Create Browser Test Checklist - ✓ Done (commit 8bb040b)
- Task 2: Document Browser Test Results - ⏸ Checkpoint reached

**Browser Checklist Created:** `.planning/phases/24-performance-final-qa/24-02-BROWSER-RESULTS.md`
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Wave 1 (current)
- **24-01 Task 4:** User approves audit results → agent completes SUMMARY.md
- **24-02 Task 2:** User reports browser test results → agent documents and completes SUMMARY.md

## Wave 2 (blocked on Wave 1)
- **24-03:** Final accessibility and QA pass (3+ tasks)
  - Depends on 24-01 and 24-02 completion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- LCP target was 1.0s, actual is 1.5s desktop - needs user decision on whether acceptable
- Mobile scores use aggressive Lighthouse throttling (4x CPU slowdown + slow 4G) - real-world will be better
- CLS at 0.0003/0.0088 is excellent (well under 0.1 threshold)
- Animations verified safe (transform/opacity only, no layout thrashing)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- **User input needed (24-01):** Approve or reject 1.5s LCP vs 1.0s target
- **User input needed (24-02):** Test browsers and report results (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, mobile)
</blockers>

Phase 24 is the final phase of v7 milestone (Comprehensive Frontend Redesign). This phase verifies that all the design system, typography, layout, and motion work from Phases 20-23 didn't break performance or accessibility.

The orchestrator spawned two gsd-executor agents in parallel for Wave 1. Both agents completed their automated tasks and hit checkpoints requiring human verification. The agents returned with checkpoint IDs:
- 24-01 agent: a2c59f7
- 24-02 agent: a105e29

However, these agent IDs may not be resumable in a new session. Instead, use the continuation pattern: spawn fresh agents with explicit state from SUMMARYs and checkpoint context.

Lighthouse JSON files were created in project root during audit:
- lh-desktop-1.json, lh-desktop-2.json, lh-desktop-3.json
- lh-mobile-1.json, lh-mobile-2.json, lh-mobile-3.json
- run-lighthouse.js (the script used)
</context>

<next_action>
When resuming:

1. **Get user input for both checkpoints:**
   - "Is 1.5s LCP acceptable vs 1.0s target?" → approved/rejected
   - "Browser test results?" → Chrome: PASS, Firefox: PASS, etc.

2. **Complete Wave 1:**
   - Spawn continuation agents for 24-01 and 24-02 with user responses
   - Agents will document results in SUMMARYs

3. **Execute Wave 2:**
   - Spawn 24-03 (accessibility + final QA) after Wave 1 completes

4. **Verify phase goal:**
   - Spawn gsd-verifier after all plans complete
   - Update ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md

5. **Complete v7 milestone:**
   - Phase 24 is the last phase of v7
   - Route to `/gsd:audit-milestone` or `/gsd:complete-milestone`
