## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion — Full Visual Design Authority

User has delegated visual design decisions to Claude's judgment. Research best practices for:

1. **Pricing tier layout**
   - Column style vs horizontal cards
   - All Access positioning and emphasis
   - Visual hierarchy of packages
   - Price display patterns

2. **Course browser presentation**
   - Card grid vs alternative layouts
   - Information density per course
   - Tab/filtering approach
   - Visual grouping

3. **Content updates**
   - Copy/messaging improvements
   - Course description refinement
   - Pricing display style

4. **Visual style alignment**
   - Match Hero/Trust design language
   - Colors, shadows, typography consistency
   - Spacing and rhythm
   - Mobile responsiveness

**Research directive:** Investigate education/tutoring sector website best practices and apply professional visual design patterns. User trusts Claude to make informed decisions.

## Specific Ideas

**Existing v2 patterns to match:**
- Hero section: Modern gradients, bold typography, clear hierarchy
- Trust section: Card-based, testimonials, tutor profiles
- About section: Section-tag, clamp typography, v2 pill badges

**Current state observations:**
- Pricing tiers are functional but visually dated compared to Hero/Trust
- Course browser has 24 cards across 3 year tabs
- All Access hero banner at top is prominent
- Cards have consistent structure but could be more compact/scannable

**User context:**
- User is not confident in visual design decisions
- Prefers Claude to research and apply best practices
- Trusts professional judgment over personal preferences
