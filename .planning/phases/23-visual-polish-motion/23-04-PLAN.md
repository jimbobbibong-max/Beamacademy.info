<objective>
Add high-impact hover states and micro-interactions to interactive elements throughout the page.

Purpose: Provide tactile feedback that makes the site feel responsive and alive; reinforce interactivity
Output: Polished hover states on cards, buttons, and links with consistent timing and easing
</objective>

Key research findings:
- Card hover: translateY(-4px) + shadow-lg
- Button hover: scale(1.02) or translate based on design
- Link underline: ::after width animation from 0 to 100%
- Timing: 150-200ms for micro-interactions (MOT-04)
- Easing: ease or cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Only animate transform/opacity for performance

Requirements satisfied:
- MOT-02: High-impact hover states on interactive elements
- MOT-04: Animation timing 150-300ms with appropriate easing

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add card hover lift effect</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Add hover lift effect to all card elements (tutor cards, course cards, testimonial cards).

1. Find card classes in the existing CSS (likely .tutor-card, .course-card, .testimonial, or similar)

2. Add hover transition styles:

```css
/* Card hover lift effect */
.tutor-card,
.course-card,
.testimonial-card,
[class*="card"] {
  transition: transform 200ms ease, box-shadow 200ms ease;
}

.tutor-card:hover,
.course-card:hover,
.testimonial-card:hover,
[class*="card"]:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-lg, 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1));
}

/* Reduced motion: disable transform */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .tutor-card:hover,
  .course-card:hover,
  .testimonial-card:hover,
  [class*="card"]:hover {
    transform: none;
  }
}
```

ADJUST selectors to match actual class names in the HTML.

WHY -4px: Subtle lift that is noticeable but not dramatic.
WHY shadow-lg: Creates depth illusion reinforcing the lift.
WHY 200ms: Fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to be perceived.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Hover over any card element
2. Card lifts slightly (4px) and shadow deepens
3. Transition is smooth, not jarring
4. Effect releases smoothly when mouse leaves
  </verify>
  <done>All card elements have consistent hover lift effect with shadow enhancement</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add animated underline to text links</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Add animated underline effect to text links (not button links).

1. Create a class for animated links:

```css
/* Animated underline link */
.text-link {
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--purple-600, #9333ea);
}

.text-link::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -2px;
  left: 0;
  width: 0;
  height: 2px;
  background: currentColor;
  transition: width 200ms ease;
}

.text-link:hover::after {
  width: 100%;
}

/* Reduced motion: show underline instantly */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .text-link::after {
    transition: none;
  }
  .text-link:hover::after {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

2. Apply .text-link class to inline text links in the HTML (NOT CTA buttons):
- Navigation links (if not already styled)
- "Learn more" type links
- Footer links
- Any anchor text within paragraphs

WHY ::after: Creates underline that can animate width.
WHY 2px height: Visible but not overwhelming.
WHY currentColor: Inherits text color automatically.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Hover over a text link
2. Underline animates from left to right
3. Underline disappears smoothly on mouse leave
4. CTA buttons are NOT affected (they have their own hover state)
  </verify>
  <done>Text links have animated underline that slides in on hover</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Enhance secondary button hover states</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Add subtle scale effect to secondary/ghost buttons (buttons that are not primary CTAs).

1. Find secondary button classes (likely .btn-secondary, .btn-ghost, .btn-outline):

```css
/* Secondary button hover */
.btn-secondary,
.btn-ghost,
.btn-outline {
  transition: transform 150ms ease, background-color 150ms ease, border-color 150ms ease;
}

.btn-secondary:hover,
.btn-ghost:hover,
.btn-outline:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
}

.btn-secondary:active,
.btn-ghost:active,
.btn-outline:active {
  transform: scale(0.98);
}

/* Reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .btn-secondary:hover,
  .btn-ghost:hover,
  .btn-outline:hover,
  .btn-secondary:active,
  .btn-ghost:active,
  .btn-outline:active {
    transform: none;
  }
}
```

Note: Primary CTAs already have brutalist hover from Plan 02. This is for secondary actions only.

WHY scale(1.02): Very subtle growth that feels responsive without being cartoonish.
WHY scale(0.98) on active: Creates "pressed" feeling.
WHY 150ms: Faster than cards - buttons should feel snappy.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Hover over secondary/ghost buttons
2. Button grows slightly (2%)
3. Click shows slight shrink (pressed state)
4. Primary CTAs still use brutalist hover (not scale)
  </verify>
  <done>Secondary buttons have subtle scale hover effect distinct from primary CTA styling</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<success_criteria>
Phase 23 Plan 04 complete when:
1. Cards feel interactive with lift + shadow hover
2. Text links have elegant animated underline
3. Secondary buttons have distinct but subtle hover feedback
4. All interactive elements provide clear visual feedback
5. MOT-02 requirement satisfied (high-impact hover states)
