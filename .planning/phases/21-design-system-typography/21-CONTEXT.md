# Phase 21: Design System & Typography Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Establish the distinctive visual foundation for v7 redesign: typography system, CSS design tokens (spacing, colors, shadows), and one memorable visual differentiator. This phase creates the design system that all subsequent v7 phases build on.

NOT in scope: Layout changes, motion/animation, conversion optimization, mobile-specific work (those are Phases 22-24).

## Implementation Decisions

### Typography
- **Font family:** Geist Sans (Vercel's font) — distinctive, modern, technically excellent
- **Single font approach:** Geist Sans for headings AND body text, varying by weight
- **Personality:** Technical precision — clean, modern, authoritative like a premium SaaS product
- **Rationale:** Single font loads faster, is the modern trend, and Geist is proven on high-conversion sites (Vercel)

### Brand Direction
- **Feel like:** Premium SaaS (Vercel, Linear, Stripe) — clean, confident, technical
- **NOT like:** Generic tutoring sites or overly friendly/cartoon-ish edu-tech
- **Position:** BEAM is a precision tutoring instrument, not a friendly cartoon tutor

### Claude's Discretion
The following will be decided during research and planning based on best practices for premium SaaS + educational landing pages:

**Visual differentiator:**
- Angle intensity (subtle vs bold)
- Application points (section dividers, cards, buttons)
- Overall shape language implementation

**Color refinement:**
- How to use the purple (#7c3aed) palette effectively
- Accent color choices
- Contrast levels for accessibility
- Dark sections vs light sections balance

**Spacing & rhythm:**
- Tight/dense vs generous/airy
- Grid system definition
- Section padding and element spacing
- Responsive spacing scales

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Reference brands: Vercel, Linear, Stripe — technical precision, confident, premium
- Shape language direction: Diagonal/angled elements (suggests progress, movement — fitting for education)
- Font: Geist Sans specifically chosen for Vercel association and modern tech credibility
- Existing brand color (purple #7c3aed) should remain dominant — use as solid, not gradient
