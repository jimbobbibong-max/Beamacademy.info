# Phase 17: Courses Section Overhaul - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Complete structural overhaul of the Courses/Pricing section based on industry best practices. This includes:
- SaaS pricing page conversion patterns
- Course platform pricing psychology
- Value ladder presentation
- Feature comparison tables
- Social proof placement on pricing
- Checkout flow optimization

Scope is equivalent to Hero Overhaul (v2 Phase 6) — research-driven structural changes, not CSS polish.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion (All Areas)

User has delegated all implementation decisions to Claude, guided by:
1. Research into industry best practices
2. Consistency with the existing site's design language and flow
3. Conversion optimization principles

**Specific areas to research and decide:**

#### Pricing Architecture
- Tier presentation (current: 3 tiers by year level)
- Value ladder structure
- Anchor pricing strategies
- Feature comparison tables
- All Access Pass positioning

#### Decision Flow
- User journey through section
- How visitors move: browse → select → convert
- Information disclosure timing
- Package selection UX

#### Social Proof Placement
- Where testimonials appear within pricing
- Results/outcomes integration
- Trust signals for pricing decisions

#### Entry Point & CTA Strategy
- Primary conversion action (free diagnostic currently)
- CTA prominence and placement
- Friction reduction in path to action

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

**Current implementation context:**
- 3-tier structure: Junior (7-8), Intermediate (9-10), Senior (11-12)
- All Access Pass hero banner at top
- Package selection via clickable list items
- Course browser below pricing tiers
- Year-level tab filtering for courses
- Primary CTA: "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
- Multi-subject discount structure already in place

**Guiding principles from existing site:**
- Clean, modern aesthetic with purple accent palette
- Transparent pricing is a selling point
- "No payment required. No obligation." messaging
- Maximum 8 students per class (trust signal)
- Focus on diagnostic/assessment as entry point

**Key constraint:** Must maintain brand consistency with rest of site (hero, about, etc.) that was established in v2-v4.
