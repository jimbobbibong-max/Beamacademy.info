<objective>
Restructure pricing architecture with proper value ladder and savings display

Purpose: Implement industry best practice pricing psychology - anchor pricing with All Access at top, show actual dollar savings instead of percentages, and label recommended options to guide decisions.

Output: Refactored Courses section with:
- Enhanced All Access banner as clear price anchor
- Dollar savings on multi-subject packages (e.g., "Save $30/wk" instead of "25% off 2nd")
- Consistent "Best Value" / "Popular" badges across tiers
- Smooth visual transition from anchor to individual options
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance All Access anchor pricing display</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Update the All Access Hero Banner (.all-access-hero) to strengthen its role as a price anchor:

    1. Add visual emphasis to make pricing more prominent:
       - Increase price font size or add visual weight
       - Add a subtle glow or border effect to draw attention
       - Consider adding "Best for 5+ subjects" or "Maximum value" subtext

    2. Ensure the "Most Popular" badge is prominent and believable

    3. Add comparison context beneath the prices:
       - "Years 9-10: $400/wk" should feel premium
       - Consider adding "Save vs 5 subjects" calculation if appropriate

    4. Update the transition text after All Access:
       - Current: "Or choose individual subjects below"
       - Keep similar but ensure it reinforces the value ladder

    CSS changes should be minimal and consistent with existing design language (purple accent palette, clean aesthetic).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All Access banner displays prominently at top of pricing section
    - Prices are clearly visible and create anchor effect
    - Badge ("Most Popular") is present and styled
    - Visual hierarchy guides eye from All Access down to individual options
  </verify>
  <done>All Access banner functions as effective price anchor with prominent pricing display</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Convert discount percentages to dollar savings</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Replace percentage-based discount messaging with actual dollar amounts saved:

    **Junior (Years 7-8) - Base $80/wk:**
    - 2 Subjects: $140/wk - Change "25% off 2nd" to "Save $20/wk"
    - 3 Subjects: $200/wk - Change "50% off 3rd" to "Save $40/wk" (saves $80 x 3 = $240 vs $200 = $40)

    **Intermediate (Years 9-10) - Base $100/wk:**
    - 2 Subjects: $175/wk - Change "25% off 2nd" to "Save $25/wk"
    - 3 Subjects: $250/wk - Change "50% off 3rd" to "Save $50/wk"
    - 4 Subjects: $300/wk - Change "4th free" to "Save $100/wk" or keep "4th FREE!" (more compelling)
    - All Access: $400/wk - Keep "Unlimited" or add "Save $X vs 5 subjects"

    **Senior (Years 11-12) - Base $120/wk:**
    - 2 Subjects: $210/wk - Change "25% off 2nd" to "Save $30/wk"
    - 3 Subjects: $300/wk - Change "50% off 3rd" to "Save $60/wk"
    - 4 Subjects: $360/wk - Change "4th free" to "Save $120/wk" or keep "4th FREE!"
    - All Access: $500/wk - Keep "Unlimited" or add savings context

    Note: "4th free" is already compelling - consider keeping it or using "4th FREE!" for impact.

    Update the .pkg-save spans with the new text content.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All multi-subject packages show dollar savings (Save $X/wk format)
    - Math is correct for each tier
    - "4th free" or "4th FREE!" retained for maximum impact
    - All Access still shows "Unlimited"
  </verify>
  <done>All package options display dollar savings instead of percentages, making value immediately clear</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Standardize tier badges and popular options</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Standardize the "Best Value" / "Popular" badges across all tiers to guide decisions:

    **Current state:**
    - Junior: 3 Subjects has "Best Value" badge
    - Intermediate: 4 Subjects has "Popular" badge, All Access has no badge
    - Senior: 4 Subjects has "Popular" badge, All Access has "Best Value" badge

    **Target state (apply Goldilocks principle - guide to middle tier):**
    - Junior: 3 Subjects = "Best Value" (keep as-is, only 3 options)
    - Intermediate: 3 Subjects = "Best Value" (change from 4 Subjects)
    - Senior: 3 Subjects = "Best Value" (change from All Access)

    Rationale: Research shows 60-70% choose the middle option when labeled. 3 Subjects at each tier is the sweet spot for most families.

    Also ensure badge styling is consistent:
    - Use .pkg-badge class consistently
    - Same color/style for "Best Value" badges
    - Remove or relocate any "Popular" badges that conflict

    Note: All Access items (.all-access class) can keep "Unlimited" as their value proposition without needing a badge.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Each tier has exactly one "Best Value" badge on the 3 Subject option
    - Badge styling is consistent across all tiers
    - All Access options use "Unlimited" messaging without competing badges
    - Visual hierarchy makes 3 Subjects the obvious choice per tier
  </verify>
  <done>Tier badges standardized with consistent "Best Value" on 3 Subject options across all year levels</done>
</task>

</tasks>
