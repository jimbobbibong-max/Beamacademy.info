<objective>
Integrate social proof at pricing decision points

Purpose: Research shows testimonials increase conversions by 34% but only when placed at decision points. Move social proof INTO the pricing section, not separate.

Output:
- Stats strip beneath section header (500+ students, 4.9 rating, 95% improve)
- Brief outcome testimonial between pricing tiers and course browser
- Enhanced risk reversal near CTAs
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add stats strip beneath section header</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Add a compact social proof stats strip immediately after the section header and before the All Access hero:

    Location: After `</header>` (section-header) and before the All Access hero banner

    HTML structure:
    ```html
    <div class="pricing-social-proof">
        <div class="proof-stat">
            <span class="proof-number">500+</span>
            <span class="proof-label">Students Enrolled</span>
        </div>
        <div class="proof-stat">
            <span class="proof-number">4.9</span>
            <span class="proof-label">Google Rating</span>
        </div>
        <div class="proof-stat">
            <span class="proof-number">95%</span>
            <span class="proof-label">Improve in First Term</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

    CSS styling (add to existing styles):
    - Flexbox layout, centered, with gaps
    - Subtle background (light gray or transparent)
    - Numbers: large, bold, purple accent
    - Labels: smaller, gray-600
    - Mobile: stack vertically or keep horizontal with smaller font
    - Match existing site design language

    Keep it compact - this is supporting info, not a hero element.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Stats strip appears between section header and All Access banner
    - Three stats displayed: 500+ students, 4.9 rating, 95% improve
    - Styling is clean and matches site aesthetic
    - Mobile responsive (doesn't break layout)
  </verify>
  <done>Stats strip displays key trust metrics at top of pricing section</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add outcome testimonial after pricing tiers</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Add a brief, outcome-focused testimonial between the pricing tiers and the course browser:

    Location: After the `.pricing-tiers-new` div and before the `.course-browser-divider`

    HTML structure:
    ```html
    <blockquote class="pricing-testimonial">
        <p class="testimonial-quote">"The diagnostic showed exactly where my son was struggling. Within two terms, his maths mark went from 65% to 89%."</p>
        <cite class="testimonial-cite">
            <span class="testimonial-name">Parent of Year 10 Student</span>
            <span class="testimonial-school">Carlingford High School</span>
        </cite>
    </blockquote>
    ```

    CSS styling:
    - Centered, max-width for readability (600-700px)
    - Subtle left border or quotation styling
    - Quote text: slightly larger, italic or distinct
    - Citation: smaller, gray
    - Background: subtle (very light purple or transparent)
    - Padding/margin to create visual breathing room
    - Match existing testimonial styling from trust section if possible

    Note: Use a realistic testimonial - the format matters more than exact wording. Focus on OUTCOME (mark improvement) not just satisfaction.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Testimonial appears between pricing tiers and course browser
    - Quote mentions specific outcome/improvement
    - Styling is consistent with site design
    - Doesn't interrupt flow or feel intrusive
  </verify>
  <done>Outcome testimonial validates pricing decision before user scrolls to courses</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Enhance risk reversal messaging near CTAs</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
    Strengthen risk reversal messaging at key CTA points:

    1. **Section header description** - Already has "No payment required. No obligation." - ensure it's visually prominent (not just regular text)

    2. **Tier CTAs** - Each `.tier-cta` button currently says "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
       - Add small text below or near each CTA: "No payment required"
       - Or add a small icon/checkmark

    3. **After pricing tiers** - Consider adding a brief guarantee line:
       - "Your free diagnostic is yours to keep, even if you don't enrol."

    Implementation options (choose one that fits cleanly):
    - Add `.risk-reversal` span below each tier CTA
    - Add a single risk-reversal banner after all tiers
    - Style the existing "No payment required. No obligation." in the header more prominently

    CSS: Small text, subtle but visible, builds trust without screaming.

    Keep changes minimal - research shows risk reversal works best when simple and direct.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - "No payment required" or similar appears near pricing CTAs
    - Risk reversal is visible but not overwhelming
    - Consistent styling across all instances
    - Messaging is clear: free diagnostic, no obligation
  </verify>
  <done>Risk reversal messaging prominently displayed at decision points</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completing all tasks:
1. View the Courses section in browser
2. Confirm stats strip appears at top with 3 metrics
3. Confirm testimonial appears between pricing and course browser
4. Confirm risk reversal messaging visible near CTAs
5. Test mobile view to ensure new elements render correctly

- Outcome testimonial appears at decision point (after pricing)
- Risk reversal messaging visible near CTAs
- All new elements match site design language
- Mobile responsive
