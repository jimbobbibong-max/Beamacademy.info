# Plan 21.1-03 Summary: Hero Transformation

## What Was Built

Hero section transformation with distinctive editorial styling:

1. **Tilted Fraunces headline** — -2deg rotation on desktop, straight on mobile
2. **Fraunces WONK axis** — Quirky personality in letterforms (WONK 1 desktop, 0.5 mobile)
3. **Purple CTA with glow** — Primary button uses purple-700 with shadow-purple glow (changed from lime per user feedback)
4. **Editorial spacing** — Design tokens applied throughout hero section

## User Feedback Applied

## Verification

- ✓ Hero headline tilted on desktop
- ✓ Tilt removed on mobile (<768px)
- ✓ Purple CTA with glow effect approved by user
- ✓ Editorial feel achieved

## Next
