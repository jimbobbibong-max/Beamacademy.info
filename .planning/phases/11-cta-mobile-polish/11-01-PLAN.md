<objective>
Update all CTA buttons from action-focused copy ("Book Free Trial") to outcome-focused copy ("Get Your Free Diagnostic") throughout the landing page.

Purpose: Outcome-focused CTAs convert better because they emphasize what the user GETS, not what they must DO. "Get Your Free Diagnostic" highlights the tangible deliverable (the diagnostic report).

Output: All ~35 CTA instances updated with consistent outcome-focused messaging.

  <name>Task 1: Update primary CTAs to outcome-focused copy</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Update the following CTA instances with outcome-focused copy:

**Primary CTAs (use "Get Your Free Diagnostic"):**
- Line 5590: Nav CTA - change "Book Free Trial" to "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
- Line 5611: Mobile nav - change "Book Free Trial" to "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
- Line 5627: Hero button - change "Book Free Trial" to "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
- Line 7055: Bottom CTA section - change "Start Your Free Trial" to "Get Your Free Diagnostic"
- Line 7066: Sticky CTA bar - change "Book Free Trial" to "Get Your Free Diagnostic"

**Form submit button (use "Get My Free Diagnostic" for personal ownership):**
- Line 7030: Change "Book Your Free Trial" to "Get My Free Diagnostic"

**Contact section title (use "Get Your Free Diagnostic"):**
- Line 6885: Change "Book Your Free Trial" to "Get Your Free Diagnostic"

**Pricing tier CTAs (use "Start Free" for brevity):**
- Lines 6174, 6194, 6214: Change "Start Free Trial" to "Start Free"

**Course card CTAs (use "Try Free" for brevity):**
- Lines 6246-6605 (22 instances): Change "Book Trial" to "Try Free"

**Skip link in package modal (keep action verb since it's navigation):**
- Line 6949: Change "Book Free Trial" to "Skip to Form"

**JavaScript dynamic text:**
- Line 7676: Change 'Book Your Free Trial' to 'Get My Free Diagnostic'
- Line 7656: Change 'Book Your ' + currentPkg + ' Trial' to 'Start ' + currentPkg + ' Trial'

**Modal continue button:**
- Line 7158: Change "Continue to Book Trial" to "Continue"

Do NOT change:
- "Pay Now" buttons (these are for existing customers)
- Footer links (these are navigation, not CTAs)
- Form labels or field names
  </action>
  <verify>
Run grep to confirm all primary CTAs updated:
- `grep -n "Get Your Free Diagnostic" beamacademy-index.html` should show 6+ matches
- `grep -n "Get My Free Diagnostic" beamacademy-index.html` should show 2 matches (form submit + JS)
- `grep -n "Book Free Trial" beamacademy-index.html` should show 0 matches
- `grep -n "Book Your Free Trial" beamacademy-index.html` should show 0 matches
  </verify>
  <done>
CTA-01 satisfied: All user-facing CTAs use outcome-focused copy emphasizing "Get Your Free Diagnostic" or appropriate shorter variants for constrained contexts. No more action-focused "Book" or "Start Your" patterns remain.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify form field count unchanged</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/beamacademy-index.html</files>
  <action>
Verify that the form still has exactly 4 visible fields (no more, no less):

1. Count visible form inputs in the contact form section
2. Confirm the fields are: Name, Email (optional), Phone, Year Level (optional)
3. Document the field count in verification output

This is a verification task - no changes expected. The research confirmed 4 fields exist.
  </action>
  <verify>
Count form inputs:
- `grep -c "form-input\|form-select" beamacademy-index.html` in the contact form section
- Should be 4 visible fields (Name, Email, Phone, Year Level)
- Hidden fields (form-name, package, subjects, price, bot-field) don't count
  </verify>
  <done>
CTA-02 satisfied: Form has 3-4 visible fields as required. Document the exact count.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing all tasks:

1. **CTA copy audit:**
   - Grep for old patterns: "Book Free Trial", "Book Your Free Trial", "Start Your Free Trial"
   - All should return 0 matches

2. **New pattern verification:**
   - "Get Your Free Diagnostic" appears in nav, hero, sticky bar, bottom CTA
   - "Get My Free Diagnostic" appears in form submit button
   - Shorter variants ("Start Free", "Try Free") appear in cards

3. **Form field count:**
   - Confirm 4 visible fields remain
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. All primary CTAs updated to outcome-focused copy
2. CTA copy consistent across all user touchpoints
3. Form field count verified as 3-4 fields
4. No "Book" action verbs remain in CTAs (except Pay Now which is for different flow)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/11-cta-mobile-polish/11-01-SUMMARY.md`
