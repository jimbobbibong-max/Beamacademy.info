<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Physics landing page</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/physics.html</files>
  <action>
Create a standalone HTML file for Physics tutoring. Copy the full design system from beamacademy-index.html.

**Physics-specific content:**
1. **Hero**:
   - Headline: "Make Physics Click"
   - Subheadline: "From confusion to clarity. We break down complex concepts into intuitive understanding that sticks."
   - CTA: "Get My Free Diagnostic"

2. **Social proof** - Physics-specific testimonial:
   - "The way they explained wave motion finally made sense. Went from 65% to 88%."
   - Student or parent attribution

3. **What We Cover** (Years 11-12 only):
   - **Year 11**: Kinematics, Dynamics, Waves & Thermodynamics, Electricity & Magnetism
   - **Year 12 HSC Modules**:
     - Module 5: Advanced Mechanics (projectile motion, circular motion, gravitation)
     - Module 6: Electromagnetism (motors, generators, transformers)
     - Module 7: The Nature of Light (wave-particle duality, special relativity)
     - Module 8: From the Universe to the Atom (nuclear physics, quantum mechanics)
   - Practical investigation skills
   - HSC exam technique

4. **Our Approach** - Same methodology, emphasize:
   - Visual and conceptual explanations
   - Problem-solving strategies
   - Practice with past HSC questions

5. **Unique to Physics:**
   - Emphasize mathematical application
   - "See the physics behind everyday phenomena"
   - HSC Module-by-module mastery

**Note:** Physics is Years 11-12 only at BEAM Academy (no Year 7-10 physics).

1. Open physics.html in browser - loads without console errors
2. Utility bar with phone number visible
3. Hero shows physics-specific headline
4. Only Years 11-12 content shown (no junior years)
5. Form and navigation functional

  <name>Task 2: Create Chemistry landing page</name>
  <files>C:/Users/bskim/Downloads/chemistry.html</files>
  <action>
Create a standalone HTML file for Chemistry tutoring. Same structure as physics.html but with Chemistry-specific content.

**Chemistry-specific content:**
1. **Hero**:
   - Headline: "Master the Science of Matter"
   - Subheadline: "From balancing equations to organic synthesis. We build deep understanding from atomic level up."
   - CTA: "Get My Free Diagnostic"

2. **Social proof** - Chemistry-specific testimonial:
   - "Finally understood stoichiometry! Jumped from struggling to top 10 in the cohort."
   - Student or parent attribution

3. **What We Cover** (Years 11-12 only):
   - **Year 11**: Properties of Matter, Quantitative Chemistry, Reactive Chemistry, Drivers of Reactions
   - **Year 12 HSC Modules**:
     - Module 5: Equilibrium and Acid Reactions
     - Module 6: Acid/Base Reactions (pH, buffers, titrations)
     - Module 7: Organic Chemistry (functional groups, reactions, polymers)
     - Module 8: Applying Chemical Ideas (analysis, industrial chemistry)
   - Practical skills and depth studies
   - HSC exam technique

4. **Our Approach** - Same methodology, emphasize:
   - Step-by-step problem solving
   - Visual models for molecular concepts
   - Practice with calculations and HSC-style questions

5. **Unique to Chemistry:**
   - Emphasize calculation skills (moles, concentration, pH)
   - "Understand reactions at the molecular level"
   - Organic chemistry synthesis pathways

**Note:** Chemistry is Years 11-12 only at BEAM Academy.
