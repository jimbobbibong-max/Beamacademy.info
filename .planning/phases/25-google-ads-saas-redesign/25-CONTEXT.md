# Phase 25: Google Ads Website Optimization + Premium SaaS Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Apply Google Ads POP recommendations (phone number, call tracking, landing pages) PLUS a comprehensive premium SaaS aesthetic overhaul guided by the Anthropic Frontend Design Skill. The goal is a distinctive, non-generic landing page that converts high-intent Google Ads traffic while maintaining BEAM's purple/violet brand identity.

**Source Requirements:**
- Google POP call (2026-01-30) with Rustie Villarisco
- Frontend Design Skill principles (bold, distinctive, avoids AI slop)

## Implementation Decisions

### Design Philosophy (Frontend Design Skill)
- **Aesthetic direction:** Editorial/Magazine meets Luxury/Refined
- **Tone:** Premium SaaS feel — think Linear, Notion, but warmer for education
- **Key constraint:** MUST avoid generic AI aesthetics (no bland gradients, cookie-cutter layouts)
- **Color anchor:** Keep BEAM purple (#7c3aed) and pastel violets as foundation
- **Typography:** Keep Fraunces (display) + Bricolage Grotesque (body) from v7

### Phone Number Placement
- Sticky header utility bar above main navigation
- Phone only, minimal design (no hours/location clutter)
- Stays visible on scroll
- Click-to-call functionality on mobile (tel: link)

### Mobile Call Experience
- Claude's discretion on whether to add floating call FAB button
- Must be thumb-friendly if added
- Research shows 70% of mobile searchers use click-to-call

### Call Tracking (Google Ads)
- Implement "Calls from Website" conversion action
- Add Google Ads call tracking script for attribution
- Track as conversion in Google Ads dashboard

### Subject-Specific Landing Pages
- Create pages for Google Ads Sitelink Assets
- Subjects: Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry
- Each page optimized for that subject's Google Ads traffic
- Consistent design system across all pages

### Claude's Discretion (Frontend Design Skill Leads)
- Overall page structure and section composition
- Spacing, visual rhythm, negative space
- Motion and micro-interactions
- Click-to-call button styling (should fit premium aesthetic)
- Landing page layouts and content hierarchy
- Any bold differentiators (asymmetry, grid-breaking, texture)
- Whether to add mobile floating call button

## Specific Ideas

### Premium SaaS Research Findings (2026)

**Key patterns to consider:**
- Bold serif headlines with expressive color palettes
- Micro-animations that add meaning (not noise)
- Interactive product demos/previews in hero
- Single conversion goal per page
- Social proof near CTAs (3-10x higher conversion)

### Click-to-Call Best Practices

**Key insights:**
- Above-fold placement critical — users decide within seconds
- 70% of mobile searchers use click-to-call feature
- Click-to-call can increase conversions up to 200%
- 61% of click-to-call users are ready to purchase
- Place phone near testimonials/trust badges

### Reference Aesthetic
- Linear: Minimalism-meets-premium UX
- Notion: Clean with strong messaging
- But WARMER — tutoring is human connection, not cold SaaS

### Brand Colors (Non-Negotiable)
- Primary: Purple #7c3aed
- Pastel violets: #e9d5ff, #d8b4fe, #c084fc
- Gold accent (from v7): #f59e0b — use sparingly

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.

The scope is already comprehensive (Google Ads items + full SaaS redesign), so any additional features would belong in future phases.
