# Phase 10: Support Section - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Differentiate BEAM with 24/7 Discord support between classes. This section communicates ongoing support availability as a key differentiator. The section includes a Discord callout, availability framing, and a screenshot showing real help in action.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User has delegated all implementation decisions to research and planning phases:

**Visual presentation:**
- Discord screenshot style (mockup vs real, phone frame vs browser, etc.)
- Visual treatment of the Discord interface

**Messaging framing:**
- Exact copy beyond "Stuck at 9pm? Get help by 10am." baseline
- Tone and parent concern language
- How to communicate 24/7 availability credibly

**Section layout:**
- Placement relative to other sections
- Card/container styling
- Icon usage and background treatment
- Desktop vs mobile presentation

**Screenshot content:**
- What type of exchange to show (math help, quick question, etc.)
- Timing visibility (showing response speed)
- Student question and tutor response content

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches.

Requirements from roadmap provide the anchors:
- SUPP-01: Discord 24/7 support callout section
- SUPP-02: "Stuck at 9pm? Get help by 10am." framing
- SUPP-03: Discord screenshot showing real exchange
