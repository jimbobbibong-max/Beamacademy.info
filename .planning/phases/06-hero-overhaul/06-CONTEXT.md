# Phase 6: Hero Overhaul - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign the hero section so visitors immediately understand what BEAM is (HSC tutoring) and why it's different (custom materials based on score tracking). Visitors should identify category and differentiator within 3 seconds without scrolling.

## Implementation Decisions

### Headline tone & wording
- Parent-focused outcome — speaks to what parents want to know ("where they're struggling")
- HSC mentioned in category label only, not in headline itself
- Headline focuses purely on outcome/benefit
- Medium length (7-10 words) — more context than ultra-short

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact headline wording (within the parent-outcome, medium-length parameters)
- Subheadline content — Claude picks what best complements the headline (HOW/mechanism, WHAT/deliverable, or PROOF/credibility)
- Portal screenshot placement and prominence
- Visual hierarchy and layout decisions
- Category label styling (badge vs text treatment)
- Desktop vs mobile arrangement
- CTA positioning relative to content
